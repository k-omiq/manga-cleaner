"""mflux / MLX backend implementation for FLUX.2 Klein 4B inpainting.

Implements MLX allocator bounding, a working resolution for small crops, and
verified MLX inference hooks for Apple Silicon.

**Why no `MemorySaver`.** `mflux`'s `MemorySaver` is the callback that applies
two of the four guards this backend used to echo, and one of them - nulling the
text encoder before the denoising loop whenever `num_seeds <= 1` - makes the
*second* render through one open throw, because FLUX.2 re-encodes the prompt on
every call and has no `prompt_cache` to fall back on. The callback is therefore
not registered: the encoder is kept, one open serves many renders, and what
bounds this process is `mx.set_memory_limit` / `mx.set_cache_limit` plus the
parent's per-region peak check. The price is standing footprint, and
`DEFAULT_DECLARED_WORKING_SET` below is raised to pay it honestly rather than
declaring the evicting figure.

**VAE tiling is per render, not per open**, for the same honesty reason: it
helps a large crop's decode spike and *hurts* a small one, because `mflux` tiles
the encode above 512 px and the decode above a 512 px output, blending the tiles
with a cosine ramp - seams across exactly the working resolution this backend
now upscales small crops to. So it is switched on the crop, and no longer echoed
at open as though it applied to every render.

#: Declared working set, 10 GiB. Sized for a model that **keeps** its text
#: encoder and edits the untiled arm at :data:`WORK_LONG_SIDE`: measured
#: 8.36 GB of peak physical footprint for two renders against 6.58 GB
#: for the evicting path; two renders of two tight crops measured 8.92 GB here,
#: and the largest shape the untiled arm can reach - 768² - measured **9.77 GB**.
#: The rule is that understating this figure is the one direction that is not
#: safe, because it is what the hardware gate admits this process onto a machine
#: with, so the declaration sits above the largest figure measured and not on it.
#: What it still does not cover is the *tiled* arm: a crop past
#: :data:`VAE_TILING_FREE_LONG_SIDE` costs more than this and always did.
DEFAULT_DECLARED_WORKING_SET = 10_737_418_240

#: Long side a small crop is upscaled to before the edit, and downscaled back
#: from afterwards. FLUX.2 edit resolves poorly on tiny inputs - a crop where
#: the glyphs are twenty pixels tall comes back as a smudge - and ~768 px gives
#: the model enough to reconstruct screentone without paying full-page cost.
#: Snapped to :data:`LATENT_STRIDE`.
#:
#: **Swept, and it is this repository's figure now rather than the reference
#: implementation's.** 512, 1024 and the reference's own
#: ~1 megapixel *area* target were each run against 768 on both fixture regions
#: at the winning prompt:
#:
#: * **512** is the failure this constant exists to prevent, still: the balloon
#:   came back 73 grey levels dark with 36 levels of invented texture.
#: * **1024** and **~1MP** both replaced a flat white balloon with a fabric-weave
#:   texture 23 to 28 levels dark under the shipped prompt, were no better than
#:   768 on the sound effect under the winning one, and cost 2–6× the wall clock
#:   (13 s → 25 s → 60 s for one balloon region on an M5).
#:
#: So the good arm is narrow and 768 sits inside it. The upscale filter was swept
#: too: LANCZOS in both directions - which is what the reference uses - measured
#: no better than the bicubic-up / area-down pair below and looked slightly
#: heavier on halftone, so the pair stays.
WORK_LONG_SIDE = 768

#: The working resolution is snapped down to a multiple of this, because a
#: latent-space model works in multiples of its patch and VAE downsampling
#: factor and silently resizes anything else. Same number as
#: `cleaner_core::engines::flux::LATENT_STRIDE`, on purpose.
LATENT_STRIDE = 16

#: At or below this working long side the VAE runs untiled. Above it, tiling is
#: applied, which is what this backend used to do for every render.
#:
#: Equal to :data:`WORK_LONG_SIDE` on purpose, and the two must stay equal: the
#: untiled arm is then exactly the arm a small crop was upscaled into, which is
#: the one tiling would seam, and a crop that arrives larger than the working
#: resolution is tiled as it always was. It also bounds the untiled arm's cost -
#: a long side of 768 means an area of at most 768², which is the shape
#: :data:`DEFAULT_DECLARED_WORKING_SET` is measured against.
#:
#: The sweep leaves this threshold where it is *and* retires the
#: question it was going to raise. Tiling was measured on the arm above it - a
#: 1024 long side and a ~1MP one, each rendered tiled and untiled - and it moved
#: the result by under half a grey level while costing roughly twice the wall
#: clock (72 s tiled against 25 s untiled at 1024). It neither rescued the large
#: arm nor spoiled it; the large arm is worse than 768 either way. So no render
#: wants to be above this threshold, and its only remaining job is the one it
#: always had: bounding a crop that *arrives* larger than the working resolution.
