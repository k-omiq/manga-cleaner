"""SDNQ / torch + diffusers backend for FLUX.2 Klein edit inpainting.

**Why this file exists.** `backend/mflux.py` is MLX, and MLX is Apple Silicon.
Rung 3a reopened for the machine with a discrete GPU, and that machine cannot
run a line of `mflux`. This is the
portable arm: `torch` plus `diffusers`, with `sdnq`'s 4-bit quantized weights,
on CUDA, Intel XPU or Metal.

It is a port of a working implementation rather than a fresh guess -
`mangaTranslator`'s `core/ml/model_manager.py::load_flux_kontext_sdnq` and
`core/image/inpainting.py::FluxKontextInpainter` - and the differences from that
reference are all in one direction: **the mask, the crop, the ramp and the
composite are not this file's business.** They are the parent's
([`cleaner_core::engines::flux`]), so the reference's bounding boxes, distance
transforms and `image_composite_masked` have no counterpart here. What is
ported is the pipeline load, the device and dtype table, the offload guards and
the denoising call.

## What bounds it, and what does not

`torch`'s caching allocator has a **fraction** setter on every accelerator it
runs on - `torch.cuda.set_per_process_memory_fraction`,
`torch.mps.set_per_process_memory_fraction` - and it bounds *reserved* memory,
which is the live allocations and the allocator's own cache together. So the
cache is capped by the same call, not purged in place of being capped, and
rule 9's second guard is met with one knob rather than two.
`torch.*.empty_cache()` is still called between
renders; it is a sweep on top of a cap, exactly as `mx.clear_cache` is on the
MLX arm, and never a substitute for one.

`PYTORCH_MPS_HIGH_WATERMARK_RATIO`
is the ancestor of the MPS call above. Its complaint was never that the guard
was wrong - it was that the guard was aimed at an allocator that was not in the
inference path. Here torch *is* the inference path, and the modern spelling of
that guard is applied to it.

**A machine with no accelerator is refused, not served slowly.** With no CUDA,
XPU or MPS device there is nothing to offload to or from and no fraction to set,
so neither required guard can be applied - and a backend that echoes a guard it
did not apply repeats that same mistake. `open` answers
`501 unbounded_backend`, which the parent reads as a decline and routes to rung
2. A 4B transformer at four bits on a CPU is minutes per step regardless; the
refusal costs nothing anybody wanted.

## The working resolution is this side's, and it is the same number

The crop arrives tight and at the page's own scale - the parent never resamples
- so upscaling
a small crop to something the model can resolve glyphs in is the backend's job
on this arm exactly as it is on the MLX one. :data:`WORK_LONG_SIDE` and
:data:`LATENT_STRIDE` are deliberately the same constants as `mflux.py`'s, and
the filters are the same pair in the same directions, so the two backends differ
in their runtime and not in their framing of the problem.
