"""Memory measurement and instrumentation for Manga Cleaner sidecar.

**Which quantity is the honest one.** This module reports two different
measures of "memory used", because on macOS they differ by more than a factor
of two for this workload and only one of them is the number
rule 9 is written against.

*Resident set size* - `getrusage(RUSAGE_SELF).ru_maxrss`, and
`MACH_TASK_BASIC_INFO.resident_size` - counts pages mapped into the task's own
address space. It does **not** count the unified-memory buffers MLX allocates
through Metal, which the kernel accounts to the process under the
`IOAccelerator` tag, nor pages the process owns that are not currently mapped.
For a FLUX render essentially the whole model lives in exactly those buffers,
so RSS misses most of the cost. Worse, it is not merely low but *insensitive*:
measured on an Apple M5, a 512² render and a 1024² render both read about
2.9 GB of RSS while their true costs were 6.58 GB and 10.29 GB.

*Physical footprint* - `TASK_VM_INFO.phys_footprint`, and its kernel-maintained
high-water mark `ledger_phys_footprint_peak` - is the figure macOS itself uses
for a process's memory: it includes IOAccelerator/Metal allocations, owned
unmapped pages, and the compressor. It is the number `/usr/bin/footprint`
breaks down, the number `vmmap` prints as `Physical footprint`, the number
`/usr/bin/time -l` reports as `peak memory footprint`, and the number a user's
Activity Monitor shows. Rule 9's subject is the user's machine, so this is the
measure the wire protocol's `peak_rss_bytes` carries and the parent's cap is
checked against.

Both are reported. `instrument` names which quantity the primary fields hold so
a reader never has to guess, and the resident readings are kept alongside under
their own names so the disagreement stays visible rather than being averaged
away.
