# Independent RT-DETR-v2 and SAM-TS-L capabilities

This implementation is in the `codex/cloud-integration` worktree. The main checkout at `/Users/caved/dev/manga-cleaner` was not edited. It preserves the legacy CTD run and M0–M1 changes. The Settings panel supports local candidate review and an explicit, supervised PNG component write on the measured M5 WebGPU configuration described below.

## What is wired

| Choice | Files opened | Result |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Regions only | RT full FP32 tiled graph, or existing small INT8 whole-page graph | Text and bubble boxes in page coordinates. Bubble boxes are context. |
| Mask only | SAM encoder and high-resolution text head | Unchanged binary lettering mask and every 8-connected component. No RT, CTD, script gate, COO, or manga-ocr. |
| Text-shaped review | Selected RT graph and SAM pair | Same SAM pixels, plus RT evidence and detector-only candidates. No automatic erase. |
| COO MTSv3 | None | Polygon association API exists in fusion, but UI/runtime import and execution are blocked pending use and distribution rights. No bundle or download. |

The full RT graph and SAM pair have separate local import, SHA-256 readiness, removal, and backend choices. Full RT is `detector.onnx`, 168,481,531 bytes, SHA-256 `065744e91c0594ad8663aa8b870ce3fb27222942eded5a3cc388ce23421bd195`, revision `16e8a622f91fabc6b5b65c96d32d1183f8843546`. The existing small RT graph is 11,120,765 bytes, SHA-256 `5fe9e4f576e49d4e7e8b0e029d6d3cdc252abd4694113e1cae120e62c931ea79`, and remains managed by the legacy Models list. SAM revision is `5dd97423e0fbf2404264979136d47e8101144046`; the encoder is 1,335,305,985 bytes, SHA-256 `9b3a32f9018008cfd2c7a5b1a7eb6e20822ba43eab58918863f74ac62ecbafbe`; the head is 22,704,641 bytes, SHA-256 `a2c63ccf54e2e692a281cffd4dcda648f252ae6649dc7d23d0203e5868685281`. Import copies only user-selected local graphs and verifies the copied files. No optional model is downloaded automatically.

The native SAM path matches Pillow bilinear RGB preparation, top-left gray-128 padding, the graph's single normalization, tensor names and shapes, zero-logit threshold, padding crop, and Pillow's nearest restoration. The nearest resize uses Pillow's cumulative floating-point coordinate updates; integer center arithmetic changed 161 pixels on page 07. RT full uses the proof's two contiguous vertical tiles, Pillow bilinear 640-square input, width-height target sizes, 0.35 score threshold, and source-coordinate restoration. Fusion retains all SAM components and all RT text proposals, including detector-only ones. COO polygons can suggest fragment groups but cannot create erase pixels.

## Regression and measurements

The local saved Apocalypse 109 run verifies 45/45 original source SHA-256 hashes, 45/45 unchanged SAM mask hashes, the exact saved RT box lists and COO detection files, 922 SAM component candidates, and four detector-only candidates with no mask label. Page 02 keeps seven SAM components and two SFX grouping suggestions despite no RT box; page 16 keeps two SAM-only components; page 24's COO rock proposal has no erase mask; page 30 has no candidates; page 35 keeps four suspect SAM-only components for review. These are candidate and geometric checks, not accuracy against human labels.

Native comparisons used ONNX Runtime 1.28.0 CPU on Apple M5 / macOS, with JPEGs decoded to temporary RGB PNGs by the pinned Pillow reference. The 45-page full RT path reproduced every reference class and box coordinate; scores differed by less than `1e-4`. Native SAM masks were byte-identical on 44/45 pages; page 27 differed by **two pixels**. The [page-27 stage diagnosis](../spikes/sam-ts-l/results/native-page27-parity.md) found an identical Rust/Python prepared tensor and identical ONNX masks on shared input. The two changed pixels map to one near-zero canvas logit whose sign differs between PyTorch and ONNX Runtime; disabling or reducing ONNX graph optimization did not change that sign. This is a specific numerical blocker to exact PyTorch mask parity, not a preprocessing or restoration mismatch. The saved Python fusion run itself retains all 45 original mask hashes unchanged.

The desktop defines its input as the app-decoded `Raster`. Its JPEG decode differs from Pillow in 104,342 RGB channel samples on page 27 and changes 666 ONNX mask pixels; therefore the Pillow-decoded JPEG run cannot be an exact baseline for the desktop's original-JPEG path. Python and native ONNX Runtime produce identical masks when both receive a PNG of the app-decoded raster. Original-JPEG Pillow parity remains **unqualified**; no threshold adjustment or invented pass limit was used. The component write path accepts PNG only and requires the measured M5 WebGPU backend.

| Native CPU path | Graph bytes | Cold session load | Median page time | Peak process RSS | GPU memory |
| --- | ---: | ---: | ---: | ---: | --- |
| Full RT, two tiles | 168,481,531 | 201 ms | 732 ms including prep | 665,714,688 bytes | N/A; CPU requested |
| Existing small RT, whole page | 11,120,765 | 93 ms | 86 ms including prep | 622,870,528 bytes | N/A; CPU requested |
| SAM encoder + head, sequential sessions | 1,358,010,626 | 604 ms median per page load | 5,723 ms encoder + head; 6,327 ms including load | 8,547,975,168 bytes | N/A; CPU requested |

Cold load is the first session build in the separate native test process (RT 201 ms; SAM first page 534 ms); the SAM table also gives the median repeated per-page load because the implementation releases the large session after each page. The RT test took 39.51 seconds wall including compilation/test setup. SAM took 310.39 seconds wall and includes one long page-44 outlier. RSS is `/usr/bin/time -l` process high-water and is not a system or GPU-memory bound.

The app-downloaded ORT 1.28.0 dylib (SHA-256 `dc19bbcb2f5c9fb3c68b4f9248aa0a35065ff702c5dbeae75eac54a74da97b6d`) exposed built-in WebGPU on MacBook Air Mac17,3 / Apple M5 10-core / 32 GB / macOS 27.0. Native Rust assigned all 1,818 encoder and 386 head profiled node events per run to WebGPU, zero to CPU. Across 45 identical Pillow-prepared inputs, it matched 45/45 saved PyTorch MPS restored masks with zero changed pixels. One-session median encoder+head+raw-write was 6,303 ms (range 5,919–6,949 ms); cold encoder/head load was 689/37 ms; peak process RSS was 2,475,360,256 bytes; 20 ms sampled Metal high-water was 5,948,866,560 bytes. A focused desktop `infer_webgpu` test with a PNG version of page 07 also matched its saved mask and assigned both full graphs to WebGPU. These results do not qualify app-decoded original JPEGs. The Metal sample can miss a transient peak and overlaps RSS in unified memory. See [provider qualification](provider-qualification.md) for files and commands. Windows and Linux CPU/GPU rows remain unqualified and unselectable until matching hardware is tested.

The ignored native graph tests used `SAM_TS_RUNTIME` or `RT_RUNTIME` pointing to the local ORT 1.28.0 dylib, `RT_DECODED_DIR` / `SAM_TS_DECODED_DIR` pointing to temporary Pillow-decoded PNGs, and the local ignored proof graphs. See `rt_regions.rs` and `sam_ts.rs` for their exact environment variables. The full RT test passed; the strict full SAM test fails on page 27 by two pixels, deliberately keeping the parity gate visible.

## Release gates

The [component write contract](component-write-contract.md) limits supervised writes to explicit WebGPU analysis of PNG on the measured M5 host with the pinned app runtime. The analysis and prepared plan pin backend and runtime hash; prepare/apply recheck them, source, support, and composited underlay. Native CPU review remains 44/45 exact and cannot prepare a write. JPEG, longstrip, and other hardware remain review-only. Human-labeled pixel and instance ground truth is required before any accuracy improvement claim. Windows/Linux need matching-hardware provider tests. RT and SAM weight distribution terms must be confirmed before bundling their graphs. The [rights decision](model-rights-decision.md) excludes COO from desktop import, execution, bundling, and downloads; this is a product exclusion, not rights clearance. No paid cloud job was started.
