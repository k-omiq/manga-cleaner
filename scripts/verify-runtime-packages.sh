# What is actually inside each ONNX Runtime package.
#
# The application downloads a different archive per platform, and **they do
# not carry the same execution providers**: the macOS build
# is 32 MB with CoreML and WebGPU in it, the Linux x64 build is 9 MB with
# neither, and Windows has three different builds to choose between. A design
# that assumed one provider list would put the inpainter on the GPU on a Mac and
# silently on the CPU on Windows, with nothing to explain the difference.
#
# This downloads every package, records its sha256, and reports the execution
# providers it carries. The output is what
# `crates/cleaner-core/src/runtime/package.rs` records - the running application
# still asks the loaded runtime rather than trusting this.
#
# **How a provider is detected, and why not by `strings`.** The first attempt
# grepped the library's symbol table and reported that all six archives
# carried every provider: the provider *name strings* are compiled into every
# build and prove nothing. The script kept doing it anyway for two more
# phases. It now reads two things that ship only where a
# provider was actually built:
#
#   include/<name>_provider_factory.h    cpu, coreml, dml, webgpu
#   lib/onnxruntime_providers_<name>.*   cuda, tensorrt, and every other
#                                        provider that lives in its own library
#
# Neither is proof the provider *works*: CoreML is present in the macOS build
# and still cannot build a session for an int8 model, and the CUDA archives carry `onnxruntime_providers_cuda.dll` while
# carrying neither `cudart` nor cuDNN - which is why `accel::Accelerator::
# availability` asks the machine rather than the archive.
#
# It is a large download: the four CUDA archives are 241-455 MB each, and the
# whole set is about 2.2 GB. Pass a subset to check one thing:
#
#   scripts/verify-runtime-packages.sh                 # everything, 1.28.0
#   scripts/verify-runtime-packages.sh 1.28.0 win      # names matching "win"
