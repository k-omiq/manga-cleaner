#   1. Preflight: gh auth, clean tree, on main, synced with origin, secrets set.
#   2. Bump version in src-tauri/tauri.conf.json, package.json, and Cargo.toml.
#   3. Commit "release: vX.Y.Z", push main.
#   4. Annotated tag vX.Y.Z (message = release notes shown in the app), push it.
#   5. Watch the Release run; on failure print the failing step's log and exit 1.
#   6. Verify https://cleaner.komiq.cc/latest.json serves the new version
#      and count the published platforms.
#
# scripts/release.sh is the OTHER path: it builds and publishes from THIS
# machine only (current platform). Use ship.sh for normal releases.
