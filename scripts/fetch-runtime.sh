# Fetch the ONNX Runtime this machine needs.
#
# The runtime is not bundled. A small signed app downloads
# it on first launch and `dlopen`s it, which sidesteps `externalBin` and the
# Frameworks-dylib signing that goes with it. This is the development
# stand-in, and it mirrors the table in
# `crates/cleaner-core/src/runtime/package.rs` - that file is the authority and
# this script must not drift from it.
#
# **It is not one build.** Verified by scripts/verify-runtime-packages.sh:
#
#   macOS arm64   stock ORT 1.28.0                 cpu, coreml, webgpu
#   Windows       Microsoft.ML.OnnxRuntime.DirectML 1.24.4 + Microsoft.AI.DirectML 1.15.4
#                 + Microsoft.ML.OnnxRuntime.EP.WebGpu 0.3.0
#                                                  cpu, dml, webgpu (plugin)
#   Linux x64     stock ORT 1.28.0 + EP.WebGpu 0.3.0  cpu, webgpu (plugin)
#   Linux aarch64 stock ORT 1.28.0                 cpu only
#
# The GPU provider differs by platform and neither choice is ours. The WebGPU
# plugin is what puts a DFT-capable provider on Windows and Linux for every
# vendor; it is registered by the application when it sits beside the runtime.
#
# **Windows and Linux x64 have flavours; every other platform has one build.**
# The default is what you want: DirectML on Windows and the WebGPU plugin on
# Linux reach NVIDIA, AMD and Intel alike with nothing for the user to install,
# and both have a DFT kernel - which is what lets the inpainter run on the GPU
# at all. Set
#
#   ORT_FLAVOUR=cuda12   (or cuda13)
#
# for the NVIDIA build instead. Read the trade first: on Windows those archives
# carry no DirectML and the process loads exactly one library. CUDA has no DFT
# kernel, so the detector reaches CUDA and the inpainter stays on the WebGPU
# plugin unpacked beside it. They are also 241-455 MB against 9-12 MB and
# need CUDA and cuDNN 9 installed by hand, which the archives do not carry.
# Point ORT_DYLIB_PATH at your own build if you want something else again.
#
# The download deliberately uses `curl`: a file that arrives carrying
# com.apple.quarantine cannot be loaded at all.
# The attribute is stripped defensively anyway.
