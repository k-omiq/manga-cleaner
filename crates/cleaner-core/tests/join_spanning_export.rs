//! Rule 8, against files on disk.
//!
//! Rule 8 and the color-fidelity export rule are one decision seen from two
//! sides, and both of them are about what ends up in a *file*:
//!
//! > A patch spanning a join is split at the page boundary, and the passthrough
//! > test uses per-page **intersection** with the global patch set, not patch
//! > ownership.
//!
//! Fidelity assertions are made here the way they're required -
//! against the written file, decoded back, never against the buffer that was
//! about to be written. A split that rounds differently on either side of a
//! join, or a page declared untouched while pixels are written into it, is
//! visible in the files and in nothing else.
//!
//! The unit tests in `export::split` cover the arithmetic. This covers the
//! claim, which is about four files and one strip.
