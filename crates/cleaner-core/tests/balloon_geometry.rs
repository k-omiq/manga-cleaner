//! What the page-side balloon test reads on the shapes balloons actually are.
//!
//! [`cleaner_core::balloon::interior`]'s own unit tests are built on rectangles,
//! and a rectangle is the one balloon shape whose corners are as far from the
//! text as its sides are. Every other shape - and every drawn balloon is some
//! other shape - pinches at the diagonal, which is where the walk used to leave
//! the balloon first and call the art beyond it picture. These are the two
//! defects that came back from real pages, held as fixtures: a balloon full of
//! lettering read as *outside a balloon*, and two balloons read as one region.
