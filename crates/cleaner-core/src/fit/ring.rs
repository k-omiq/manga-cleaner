//! What the paper around a mask looks like.
//!
//! A ring is measured outside each candidate mask and everything is decided
//! from it: whether a flat fill is faithful, what tone to fill with, and
//! whether the region has to go to a model instead. Four corrections are
//! about this ring, and each one is a case where the obvious measurement is
//! wrong:
//!
//! - **The ring is the native annulus between `dilate(k)` and `dilate(k+4)`**,
//!   not the mask's own contour.
//! - **A plane, not a constant.** A mild gradient gives a standard deviation of
//!   4–8 and passes, and then a flat fill reads as a Mach band. The deviation
//!   is measured *about the fitted plane*.
//! - **Multimodal rings are refused.** Paper at 255 abutting 245 gives σ ≈ 5,
//!   passing, while the median exists on neither side.
//! - **No near-white snap.** Rounding a median above 240 to pure white paints
//!   cream and newsprint with visible white patches.
//!
//! ## The ring is a statistic of paper, so it stops at a strong edge
//!
//! A fifth correction, and it is not in §4 because §4 assumes the annulus lands
//! on paper. It does not always. §4's own fifth correction stops a mask
//! *candidate* growing across a bubble stroke, and gives the reason -
//! "a grown candidate can cross a bubble stroke onto outside paper, score better
//! there, win, and the fill paints paper over the outline". The same object
//! reaches the annulus one ring earlier than it reaches the mask: the annulus is
//! four pixels wide and sits immediately outside the mask, so a mask that stops
//! six pixels short of a 6 px stroke has a ring lying **on** it.
//!
//! What that costs is not a rounding error. A population standard deviation is
//! not a robust statistic, and the stroke is 226 levels away from the paper: on
//! [`crate::fit::EdgeMap`]-measured fixtures, an annulus of 1 882 to 5 044
//! pixels holding 11 to 171 pixels of stroke - half a percent to five percent -
//! reads a deviation of 16 to 46 8-bit levels over an interior that is the
//! literal constant 246. `sqrt(0.005) × 226 ≈ 16` and `sqrt(0.05) × 226 ≈ 51`,
//! so the whole of that number is the contamination. Every threshold downstream
//! is stated against a page noise floor of a few levels, so the region fails its
//! fit, [`is_periodic`] finds the stroke's own length self-similar at every
//! short lag, and §5's table sends flat paper to a model that then invents text
//! into it.
//!
//! So **the annulus is restricted to the paper on the mask's own side of the
//! page's strong edges** - a flood from the ring pixels touching the mask,
//! blocked by [`crate::fit::EdgeMap`]. It is one statement, applied to every
//! statistic this module computes, including the tone
//! [`crate::engines::fill`] paints: the pixels a route is decided from and the
//! pixels a fill is measured from are the same pixels.
//!
//! **This does not blind the ring to screentone**, which is the failure that
//! would matter, and the difference is one of shape rather than of contrast - on
//! a page whose tone is as dark as its lettering, and the corpus is one, both are
//! strong edges. A stroke is a *boundary*: its gradient response runs
//! continuously from one side of the annulus to the other, so it seals and the
//! flood stops. A halftone dot's response is a ring around a core, a Sobel's
//! magnitude is not isotropic, and the shallower arcs of that ring fall under a
//! threshold set by the page's darkest ink - so the ring is broken, the flood
//! enters, and the dot stays in the sample. Measured over nine synthetic tones -
//! dot pitch 8 to 20, radius 2 to 8, level 20 to 120, and two line hatches - the
//! restricted deviation is 9 962 to 28 995 in 16-bit luma against a fail
//! threshold of 2 056, while a flat-paper balloon whose ring straddles its own
//! stroke restricts to exactly **0**. On the corpus's own tone, pitch 12 at
//! level 60, the restriction moves the deviation from 24 960 to 24 919.
//!
//! **Where that argument runs out**, because it is statistical and not absolute:
//! a dot no wider than its own response - three pixels - has no core to leak
//! into, and an annulus around a very small region holds too few dots for any of
//! them to leak. Either flattens the ring. What still refuses rung 0 there is
//! §4's fifth correction one ring in, on the mask itself, and
//! [`crate::fit::tests::a_halftone_the_ring_restriction_flattens_is_still_kept_off_rung_zero`]
//! is the test that says so. The two corrections are one statement about one
//! edge map, and this is the case where only the inner one has anything left to
//! say.
//!
//! Everything here works in 16-bit luma
//! ([`crate::image::Raster::luma16_at`]) because §4 makes the grayscale path
//! canonical and because an 8-bit measurement quantises away exactly the
//! differences these thresholds are stated in.
