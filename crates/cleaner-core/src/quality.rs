//! The decline metric: the one check every rung's output is scored by.
//!
//! It is stated in three lines:
//!
//! > reject when post-edit interior edge-energy exceeds the surround annulus
//! > by more than 2x, or when the interior histogram falls outside the
//! > annulus range
//!
//! and then says the thing that makes this a module rather than a branch inside
//! an engine: it is the "**same measurement as §5.2 step 7, applied to every
//! rung, not only cloud**". Rung 0's fill, rung 1's denoise and every model
//! above them are scored by one function, so that a review row saying
//! *declined* means the same thing whichever rung produced the pixels. §6 also
//! records why it did not exist until now - revision 2 introduced the `decline`
//! outcome without defining the metric it depends on, "which made it
//! unimplementable".
//!
//! ## The surround is the prior, and that is the whole design
//!
//! §5.3 is blunt about the error the obvious implementation makes:
//!
//! > **The structural prior comes from the annulus.** Revision 2 compared
//! > against the pre-edit interior - which contains the text being removed, so
//! > post-edit density is always lower and "the model added strokes" could
//! > never fire.
//!
//! So both sides of every comparison here are the *surround*, and the pre-edit
//! interior is never read at all.
//! [`tests::an_added_stroke_field_is_declined_even_though_the_text_it_replaced_carried_more_ink`]
//! is the test that pins it: the region is built so that revision 2's
//! comparison would have *passed* it, and it declines.
//!
//! ## Two measurements, both relative to the page
//!
//! **Edge energy** is the mean Sobel gradient magnitude
//! ([`crate::fit::sobel_magnitude`]) over a pixel set, in 16-bit luma. The
//! interior's is measured on the page **with the patch composited over it** -
//! §6 says *post-edit* - read exactly as [`crate::composite::composite`] would
//! write it, so the pixels scored are the pixels that would ship.
//!
//! **The histogram test** asks whether the region's levels belong to the paper
//! around it at all. The surround's range is its `p5..p95`, which is the
//! reading §5.2 step 5 already uses for a ring's range (`p95-p5 > 20`), widened
//! by [`crate::fit::deviation_threshold`] - the same noise-floor-relative
//! allowance the mask fit is judged against, for the reason given for every
//! other threshold in this pipeline: flat white on a JPEG q75 raw already
//! measures 5-12 levels from blocking alone, so a fixed number is either
//! dead or fires on every region of every JPEG source.
//!
//! ## What "interior" and "surround" mean to a 3×3 kernel
//!
//! An edge-energy sample counts only where its **entire 3×3 neighbourhood lies
//! on one side of the edit boundary**. Without that rule the two quantities
//! contaminate each other, and both errors favour accepting: an interior sample
//! at the mask border reads the seam rather than the region's own content, and
//! a surround sample beside the mask reaches into the pre-edit interior and
//! picks up exactly the text ink §5.3 says must not enter the prior. For the
//! same reason the surround excludes the mask's whole **bounding box** and not
//! merely the mask: the paper between a text-shaped mask's strokes is the
//! region's own interior wearing a different name.
//!
//! The histogram test needs no neighbourhood and uses every pixel of each set.
//!
//! ## The surround is 32 px wide, and 4 px was measured to fail
//!
//! The obvious surround is [`crate::fit::ring`]'s: the annulus between
//! `dilate(mask, k)` and `dilate(mask, k + ANNULUS_WIDTH)`, four native pixels
//! wide, which the fit already measures for routing. It cannot carry this
//! statistic, and the reason is the one §5.3 gives for the cloud gate's ring in
//! almost the same words - "**Ring width is declared, and it is ≥32 px**",
//! because at ten pixels "the outer half gives one block row" and the statistic
//! degenerates into the one it claimed to replace. Here the degeneration is
//! worse than a bad estimate. Screentone has a period, `ring.rs`'s own
//! periodicity check looks for periods up to 24 px, and a four-pixel band
//! around a rectangle samples that period at essentially one phase: a band
//! landing between two rows of dots reads an edge energy of **zero**, and any
//! reconstruction of the tone then exceeds it by an unbounded factor.
//!
//! Measured, by sweeping a synthetic halftone over every phase offset - dot
//! pitch 6 to 20 px, dot size 2 to 4 px - and reconstructing the tone exactly,
//! which is an output the metric must accept. The worst ratio of interior to
//! surround energy over all phases:
//!
//! | Surround width | 24×20 mask | 14×12 mask |
//! |---|---|---|
//! | 4 px | 39230 | 50338 |
//! | 8 px | 39230 | 50338 |
//! | 16 px | 5.00 | 3.95 |
//! | 24 px | 2.94 | 3.64 |
//! | **32 px** | **1.99** | 5.20 |
//!
//! At 32 px the band is wider than the longest period the pipeline claims to
//! detect, so it holds a whole cell of anything it can see, and a correct
//! reconstruction stays inside §6's factor of two.
//!
//! It is a rectangular band around the mask's bounding box rather than a
//! dilation, which is also what §5.2's ring is - a band of real page pixels
//! around a crop - and which matters practically: `Mask::dilated(32)` applies a
//! 65×65 disc at every pixel, and this runs once per region per rung.
//!
//! **What the table's last cell says, and it is a real limit.** A 14×12 mask on
//! a 20 px pitch still reaches 5.20, because the region is then smaller than
//! one cell of the texture it sits in and the two means stop being estimates of
//! the same quantity. A legitimate reconstruction can be declined there. The
//! direction is the safe one - §6's own "Leaving text is recoverable; a bad
//! fill is not" - but it is a false decline, it is not what §6 describes, and
//! it wants calibration against real fixtures rather than a synthetic sweep.
//!
//! ## Where it cannot be measured, it says so
//!
//! The failure this module
//! is most at risk of: "none of them is measured by the same function used to
//! make the decision - revision 1 had two that were unfailable". A check that
//! silently answers *accepted* because it had nothing to measure is that defect
//! wearing a verdict, so the cases where it has nothing to measure are their
//! own outcome, [`Outcome::Unmeasured`], and a caller can count them:
//!
//! - **A bitonal source.** Levels are 0 and 65535 and nothing else. A flat fill
//!   has an interior edge energy of zero, and any surround holding one ink
//!   pixel has a `p5..p95` covering the whole scale - so both tests pass by
//!   construction, on any output whatsoever.
//!   [`crate::engines::denoise::applies`] refuses bitonal for the neighbouring
//!   reason, that a source whose samples are not levels has nothing to average;
//!   this is the same sentence about measuring. Indexed and CMYK are **not**
//!   excluded: [`crate::image::Raster::luma16_at`] resolves both to real luma
//!   through the palette or the ink model, and a luma measurement over them
//!   means what it says. It is the *averaging* of palette indices that is
//!   meaningless, which is rung 1's problem and not this one.
//! - **No surround.** A mask whose bounding box is the page leaves the band
//!   empty, and [`crate::fit::RingStats`] already refuses to report a statistic
//!   over nothing for the same reason.
//!
//! Neither declines the region, because a declined region leaves text on the
//! page and §6's justification for accepting that cost - "Leaving text is
//! recoverable; a bad fill is not" - is an argument for declining when the
//! metric *fails*, not when it is absent.
//!
//! ## What it does not see
//!
//! Everything here is luma. A patch whose luma matches its surround and whose
//! chroma does not is accepted, and
//! [`tests::a_chroma_only_error_is_invisible_to_a_luma_metric`] says so out
//! loud rather than leaving it to be discovered. §6 describes no chroma test;
//! §5.2 step 6c gives the cloud rung one, and it is the cloud rung's, measured
//! after that rung's shared tone fit.
