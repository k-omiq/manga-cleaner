//! Which hardware runs a model, and who decides.
//!
//! Nothing in this application is CPU-only by design. Every session is built
//! through [`open_session`], every session gets an accelerator chosen for the
//! model it is about to run, and the user can override the choice per install.
//! What the accelerator *is* depends on the machine: CoreML on Apple silicon,
//! DirectML on any Direct3D 12 GPU (so NVIDIA, AMD and Intel alike), CUDA or
//! TensorRT where they are installed, WebGPU as a cross-vendor fallback.
//!
//! ## Why the inpainter still defaults to the CPU
//!
//! One operator decides it. LaMa's fast Fourier convolutions need `DFT`, and in
//! ONNX Runtime **`DFT` is implemented by three providers only** -
//! `core/providers/cpu/signal/dft.cc`,
//! `dml/DmlExecutionProvider/src/Operators/DmlDFT.h` and
//! `webgpu/math/dft.cc`. There is no CUDA, ROCm, CoreML, OpenVINO or TensorRT
//! implementation.
//!
//! When a provider cannot run an operator, ONNX Runtime does not fail: it
//! partitions the graph, gives the provider what it can take, and keeps the
//! rest on the CPU - with a tensor copy at every boundary. LaMa's FFT blocks
//! sit in the middle of the network, so the partition is not a tail that can be
//! sliced off; it is a dozen round trips. Measured: CoreML runs
//! LaMa at **3197 ms against 2719 ms on the CPU alone**, after a 23.7 s session
//! build. That is the mechanism, and it applies to CUDA for the same reason.
//!
//! **DirectML and WebGPU are the exceptions.** Both implement `DFT`, so on
//! either the whole graph is resident and there is no partition to pay for.
//! Which of them a machine gets is a packaging question, not a preference -
//! see [`crate::runtime::package`]: the macOS build carries WebGPU, the Windows
//! build carries DirectML, and **the WebGPU plugin rides beside every Windows
//! and Linux x64 runtime**, so every platform but Linux aarch64 has a
//! `DFT`-capable GPU provider whatever its vendor.
//!
//! ## Windows: one GPU provider for all three vendors, and CUDA beside it
//!
//! DirectML is Direct3D 12, so **NVIDIA, AMD and Intel all reach it through the
//! same download** - there is no per-vendor package to pick and no vendor
//! runtime for the user to install. It also has the `DFT` kernel, so the
//! inpainter is on the GPU there exactly as it is on a Mac. That is why
//! [`crate::runtime::package::Flavour::DirectMl`] is the Windows default and why
//! this module needs nothing vendor-specific to make a Windows machine as busy
//! as an Apple one.
//!
//! CUDA is offered as a **second flavour and never as the default**, and the
//! reason is this file's own rule rather than a preference. The two Windows
//! builds are different `onnxruntime.dll`s and the process loads exactly one, so
//! taking CUDA means giving up DirectML - and CUDA has no `DFT` kernel, so
//! [`Preference::Automatic`] never puts LaMa on it. What keeps the inpainter on
//! the GPU on that flavour is the WebGPU plugin unpacked beside it: an NVIDIA
//! user on CUDA gets the detector on CUDA and LaMa on WebGPU. Linux x64 has
//! the same two CUDA flavours on the same terms.
//!
//! ## Every figure below is an Apple M5's, and the other platforms are told so
//!
//! [`ModelProfile::measured_better`] is what was timed, and it was timed on
//! one machine, [`MEASURED_ON`]. WebGPU is in that list because it won on
//! Metal; the same provider on Windows is Direct3D 12 and on Linux is Vulkan,
//! through the plugin, and nobody has timed either. So [`choose_on`] - the
//! form every caller with a machine in reach uses - does two things off the
//! measured platform: it reports every automatic GPU choice as
//! `accel.chosen.unmeasured`, and it tries the platform's own
//! [`ModelProfile::unmeasured_candidates`] **before** the Mac's measured
//! winners. The second rule is what makes a downloaded flavour mean
//! something: on the DirectML flavour the detector and the inpainter both
//! land on DirectML, on a CUDA flavour the detector lands on CUDA, and WebGPU
//! takes whatever the platform's candidates could not - which on every CUDA
//! flavour is LaMa. A Mac reads the table exactly as before.
//!
//! CUDA also needs components this application does not ship - the CUDA runtime
//! and cuDNN 9 - which no other provider here does. [`Accelerator::availability`]
//! answers `Unavailable::MissingDependency` when they are not on the machine, so
//! a user who selects CUDA without installing it is told which of the two things
//! is missing rather than watching a session fail.
//!
//! **None of the Windows or Linux rows below were measured on that hardware.**
//! This repository has never executed there. DirectML and CUDA are
//! [`ModelProfile::unmeasured_candidates`] for that reason, reported as
//! `accel.chosen.unmeasured`, and neither has a
//! [`ModelProfile::measured_peak_rss`] row - so the memory gate does not fire on
//! either, by the rule three paragraphs down that says it gates on a measurement
//! or it does not gate.
//!
//! Measured on an M5, where the available one is WebGPU:
//!
//! | model | CPU | CoreML | WebGPU |
//! |---|---|---|---|
//! | manga-LaMa 512² | 2540 ms | 3899 ms | **1311 ms** |
//! | detector 1024² | 703 ms | **383 ms** | 548 ms |
//! | balloon 640² int8 | **129 ms** | *fails to build* | 222 ms |
//! | script-ID 48×200 | **2 ms** | - | 8 ms |
//!
//! So the inpainter is not CPU-bound after all - it is 1.9× faster on the GPU
//! than the best CPU thread count, through the one provider that has the
//! operator. And **no single provider wins**: the detector belongs on CoreML,
//! the inpainter on WebGPU, and the small models on the CPU, where the
//! transfer costs more than the compute. That is why the choice is per model
//! and why every entry below cites a measurement.
//!
//! ## Sessions are held, and regions are not batched
//!
//! Two more measurements, on the same machine, LaMa on WebGPU:
//!
//! - **Building the session costs 4.0 s and running it costs 1.47 s.** Building
//!   per region would nearly quadruple the work, so a session is opened once
//!   and held for the life of the job. Over 40 sequential runs the latency
//!   drifts +10.5%, which is worth watching and is not a leak.
//! - **Batching regions buys nothing.** manga-LaMa's only dynamic axis is
//!   `batch` - the spatial input is fixed at 512² - and per-region cost is flat
//!   from batch 1 to 4 and 29% *worse* at batch 8. A 512² LaMa saturates this
//!   GPU at batch 1. There is no batching path to build, which is the useful
//!   half of the result.
//!
//! ## A forced provider is honoured on speed, and gated on memory
//!
//! The standing ruling is that *"a forced
//! provider is honoured even when it is the slow choice, with the reason
//! reported"*, and [`Preference::Force`] below still says so. That ruling is
//! about **speed**, and the two figures that made this a question are not:
//!
//! | model | provider | peak process RSS | median |
//! |---|---|---|---|
//! | manga-LaMa | WebGPU | 740 MB | 986 ms |
//! | manga-LaMa | **CoreML** | **8.19 GB** | 1856 ms |
//!
//! It is not reachable automatically - [`Accelerator::implements_dft`] keeps
//! LaMa off CoreML - but the provider override is a per-install setting, so a
//! user can ask for it. An 8 GB working set is not a slow setting. On a machine
//! that cannot carry it, it is the failure the memory rule names: *"a runaway
//! must fail fast, into the ladder … rather than being absorbed into the memory
//! compressor, which loses the machine."*
//!
//! **So the third option was taken, and not the other two.** Not honour-and-warn,
//! because a warning is not a remedy and the thing being warned about is the
//! machine rather than the run. Not refuse-outright, because that would overturn
//! a standing ruling on the strength of a figure that is fine on the machine it
//! was measured on - 8.19 GB of a 32 GB Mac is inside what the platform grants,
//! and refusing it there would be this file inventing a policy the documents do
//! not state. What is implemented is the same arithmetic used elsewhere,
//! applied one rung down from the rung it was written for: a forced
//! provider whose **measured** peak fits what the platform will actually grant
//! is honoured, and one that does not is declined to the CPU under
//! `accel.declined.memory`, with the figure carried on the [`Declined`] so the
//! interface can say how much it would have needed.
//!
//! Three properties of that, each deliberate:
//!
//! - **It gates on a measurement or it does not gate.** The bound is
//!   [`ModelProfile::measured_peak_rss`], and a provider nobody has measured has
//!   no row there and is honoured. A guess that declines a user's setting is
//!   worse than no guess at all.
//! - **It gates on what the platform grants, not on physical RAM**, which is
//!   rule 9's fourth obligation and [`crate::memory`]'s whole subject.
//! - **[`Preference::CpuOnly`] is untouched.** It returns before any of this,
//!   because it is absolute and the golden tests pin it.
//!
//! ## What is measured, and what is not
//!
//! Every default below is marked. A number measured on one machine written down
//! as though it were general is the mistake made for the FLUX decision, and
//! this module is exactly where it would be made again - the table above is
//! an Apple M5, and a Windows machine with a discrete GPU will order these
//! differently. `spike-onnx-probe --ep <name>` is what produces it.
