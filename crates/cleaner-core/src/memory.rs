//! How much memory this machine will actually give us, asked rather than
//! assumed.
//!
//! This module fills a hole: *"Nothing queries either number:
//! `cleaner_core::accel` probes execution providers, not memory."* The two
//! numbers are physical memory, and
//! the working set the platform will actually grant, which on macOS is
//! `recommendedMaxWorkingSetSize` and is emphatically **not** total RAM.
//!
//! This module is written to the same standard [`crate::accel`] is: it **asks
//! the system**, the way [`crate::accel::available`] asks the loaded ONNX
//! Runtime which providers it was built with rather than inferring them from
//! the platform. Where it cannot ask, it says so - every answer here is an
//! `Option`, and [`Machine::basis`] records how the answer was arrived at, so a
//! caller can tell a number the kernel reported from a number this file
//! computed from a fraction written down in a design document.
//!
//! ## What can be asked, on macOS
//!
//! Through `sysctlbyname`, which is in libSystem and therefore already linked -
//! this workspace carries no `libc` dependency and does not gain one for four
//! integers:
//!
//! | key | what it answers |
//! |---|---|
//! | `hw.memsize` | physical memory, exactly |
//! | `kern.memorystatus_vm_pressure_level` | the kernel's own pressure state: normal, warn, critical |
//! | `kern.memorystatus_level` | the percentage of memory the kernel counts as available |
//! | `vm.page_free_count` × `hw.pagesize` | free pages, which is a floor on the above and not the same number |
//!
//! ## What cannot be asked, and is therefore stated as a fraction
//!
//! **`recommendedMaxWorkingSetSize` is a Metal property, not a sysctl.**
//! Reading it means a `MTLDevice`, which means an Objective-C runtime binding
//! this crate does not have and would not otherwise want. So the working set is
//! [`WORKING_SET_NUMERATOR`]/[`WORKING_SET_DENOMINATOR`] of physical memory and
//! is reported under [`Basis::Fraction`] rather than [`Basis::Reported`], which
//! is the difference between a measurement and an arithmetic claim and is
//! exactly that distinction.
//!
//! The fraction is **two thirds and not three quarters**, which is the low end
//! of the platform's own range: *"roughly 75% of
//! physical memory - about 21–24 GB of a 32 GB machine"*. 21 of 32 is 65.6%,
//! 24 of 32 is 75%, and a gate takes the low end of a range it did not measure.
//! Being generous here admits a machine that then thrashes, and
//! the rule is explicit about
//! which of the two failures is the one that matters: *"a runaway must fail
//! fast, into the ladder … rather than being absorbed into the memory
//! compressor, which loses the machine."* Declining is cheap.
//!
//! ## `os_proc_available_memory` returns zero here, and that is not a bug
//!
//! `os_proc_available_memory`
//! is "the obvious one on macOS" for a pressure signal. It was tried first and
//! it does not work for this application: the function reports the room left
//! under a **per-process** memory limit, and a plain macOS process has no such
//! limit, so it answers `0` - measured on the reference M5, not inferred. Zero
//! is indistinguishable from "no room at all", which is the worst possible
//! reading for a signal whose job is to trigger a ladder, so nothing here calls
//! it. The signal used instead is the kernel's own system-wide pressure level,
//! which is what `DISPATCH_SOURCE_TYPE_MEMORYPRESSURE` delivers and what
//! the pressure ladder is actually about.
//!
//! ## Windows and Linux
//!
//! Both are asked now. What the silence cost was recorded -
//! *"both platforms run the ladder with no memory
//! policy at all, which is a different thing from running it with a
//! conservative one"* - and the answer is the same shape as the macOS one: ask
//! the system, widen to bytes, record the basis.
//!
//! | | physical | available | free | pressure |
//! |---|---|---|---|---|
//! | **macOS** | `hw.memsize` | `kern.memorystatus_level` × physical | `vm.page_free_count` × `hw.pagesize` | `kern.memorystatus_vm_pressure_level`, the kernel's own three states |
//! | **Linux** | `/proc/meminfo` `MemTotal` | `/proc/meminfo` `MemAvailable` | `/proc/meminfo` `MemFree` | `/proc/pressure/memory` (PSI) `some`/`full` `avg10`, else derived from the available fraction |
//! | **Windows** | `GlobalMemoryStatusEx` `ullTotalPhys` | `ullAvailPhys` | none - see below | derived from `dwMemoryLoad` |
//!
//! Units and semantics are the same everywhere: bytes, and *available* always
//! means memory the kernel counts as obtainable without paging anything out -
//! `MemAvailable` and `ullAvailPhys` are both that number, not free pages.
//!
//! **Three fidelity differences, and they are differences in the pressure
//! signal only.**
//!
//! 1. **macOS is the only platform that reports pressure rather than having it
//!    derived.** `kern.memorystatus_vm_pressure_level` is the kernel's own
//!    verdict - the same one `DISPATCH_SOURCE_TYPE_MEMORYPRESSURE` delivers.
//!    Nothing on the other two answers that question directly.
//! 2. **Linux answers a near-equivalent where PSI is present.** Pressure stall
//!    information is a measurement of *time lost to memory*, which is closer to
//!    what the ladder wants than any occupancy figure: [`PSI_WARN_SOME_AVG10`]
//!    and its two companions are thresholds on it, and they are this file's
//!    numbers rather than the kernel's. PSI needs `CONFIG_PSI` and a 4.20
//!    kernel; where the file is absent - old kernels, and containers that do
//!    not mount it - the fraction below is used instead.
//! 3. **Windows, and Linux without PSI, are a fraction of occupancy and
//!    nothing more.** [`AVAILABLE_WARN_PERCENT`] and
//!    [`AVAILABLE_CRITICAL_PERCENT`] over available-against-physical. That is
//!    weaker than either of the above: it says the machine is *full*, not that
//!    anything is *stalling*, and a machine can be full and perfectly happy.
//!    It is taken because the alternative is [`Pressure::Unknown`] forever,
//!    which is a ladder that never steps, and that is judged the worse of the
//!    two.
//!
//! **Windows has no `free()` and answers `None` there.** `MEMORYSTATUSEX` has
//! no free-pages field distinct from `ullAvailPhys`, and reporting the same
//! number under two names would make a diagnostics line say something it does
//! not know. `free` is a diagnostic and never a gate ([`free`]), so nothing
//! downstream changes shape.
//!
//! **Where a platform still cannot answer, `None` still means *do not act*.**
//! A `/proc` that will not read and a `GlobalMemoryStatusEx` that fails both
//! land back on [`Basis::Unmeasured`] and [`Pressure::Unknown`], and the
//! callers are written so that is *no signal* rather than *no room* -
//! [`crate::accel::choose_within`] honours a forced provider when it has no
//! memory answer, and [`Ladder`] takes no step.
//!
//! **None of this has been run on either platform.** The parsing and the
//! derivation are unit-tested here against fixture strings, which is a test of
//! the arithmetic and not of the kernel; neither machine has ever run this,
//! and two of the three pressure signals are derived rather than reported.
