//! Finding and loading ONNX Runtime.
//!
//! The runtime is not in the bundle: a small signed application downloads it
//! on first launch and `dlopen`s it. Phase 0 spike 1 measured what that
//! costs and what breaks it, and both findings live here rather than in a
//! comment on the download.
//!
//! Two of them shape this module:
//!
//! - The application must carry `com.apple.security.cs.disable-library-validation`,
//!   because every official ONNX Runtime release is ad-hoc signed with no Team
//!   Identifier and a hardened-runtime process refuses to map it otherwise.
//! - Which archive a platform needs, and which execution providers it turns out
//!   to carry, is [`package`] - they are not the same across platforms and the
//!   difference decides whether the inpainter can leave the CPU.
//! - A runtime carrying `com.apple.quarantine` is refused by policy, and the
//!   operating system's message for that is nothing like the message for a
//!   missing file. [`LoadError`] separates the two so the interface can say
//!   which one happened.
//! - **The Windows runtime is not self-contained either**, and this is not a
//!   signing problem. The shipped `onnxruntime.dll` imports the Visual C++
//!   runtime as a regular import, which is a component the *user* installs;
//!   the loader's answer for its absence is the same numeric code as for a
//!   missing runtime, so [`LoadError::MissingDependency`] is told apart from
//!   [`LoadError::NotFound`] by whether the file is on disk. That variant's own
//!   documentation says what was read out of the binary.
//!
//! ## The WebGPU plugin
//!
//! From 1.28 ONNX Runtime ships its WebGPU provider as a **plugin library**
//! registered at run time - `Microsoft.ML.OnnxRuntime.EP.WebGpu`, one
//! `onnxruntime_providers_webgpu` per platform - rather than compiling it into
//! every general release. The macOS archive still has it built in; the
//! Windows and Linux ones do not, and the plugin is what gives them the one
//! cross-vendor provider with a `DFT` kernel ([`crate::accel`]). [`package`]
//! puts it beside the runtime on those platforms, and [`load`] registers it
//! when it is there: [`WEBGPU_PLUGIN_NAME`] in the runtime's own directory,
//! registered once, and reported through [`webgpu_plugin`] rather than
//! failing the load - a runtime whose plugin will not register is still a
//! runtime with a CPU in it.

///   `LOAD_LIBRARY_SEARCH_*` flags is set, so the open adds the runtime's own
///   directory to nothing.
/// - **`DirectML.dll` is not resolved at load anyway.** Parsing the shipped
///   `onnxruntime.dll`'s PE data directories, `DirectML.dll`, `d3d12.dll` and
///   `dxgi.dll` are the *entire* delay-import table and appear nowhere in the
///   regular one. A delay-loaded import is resolved by the delay-load helper on
///   the first call into it, through an ordinary `LoadLibrary` against the
///   process search path - long after the flags of the open that mapped the
///   runtime have stopped mattering.
///
/// So what resolves DirectML is this function and nothing else.
/// `SetDllDirectoryW` inserts one directory into the search order of every
/// later `LoadLibrary` in the process: DirectML's, and the WebGPU plugin's
/// `dxcompiler.dll` and `dxil.dll`, which are opened by the plugin rather than
/// by anything that knows where the plugin came from. **It is load-bearing for
/// the DirectML flavour and not only for the plugin.** Deleted as plugin-only
/// cleanup, the DirectML build loses its provider on the first inference rather
/// than at load, where nothing would connect the two.
///
/// `SetDllDirectoryW` holds exactly **one** directory per process, and any
/// later caller anywhere in it silently replaces the entry. So the directory is
/// set *and* the library whose loss would be unrecoverable is opened
/// immediately, by absolute path, and never freed. A module already in the
/// process's loaded list is what `LoadLibrary` resolves a bare name to before
/// it searches any directory, so pinning `DirectML.dll` makes the delay-load
/// resolution independent of who owns the directory slot by then.
/// `ort::util::preload_dylib` is that call - it exists for this, and shipping
/// `DirectML.dll` beside the application is the example in its own
