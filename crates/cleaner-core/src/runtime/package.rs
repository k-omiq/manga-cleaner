//! Which ONNX Runtime a machine needs, and what is inside it.
//!
//! The runtime is fetched after install rather than bundled, so "which
//! build" is a decision the application makes on first launch. It is not
//! one build: Microsoft publishes
//! a different archive per platform, and **they do not carry the same execution
//! providers**.
//!
//! That is the reason this module exists rather than a URL template, and it is
//! a correction. The claim that "WebGPU ships in the stock ONNX Runtime build
//! on every platform" was true of the build measured - macOS - and false
//! everywhere else. Verified by `scripts/verify-runtime-packages.sh`, which
//! reads each archive's **`include/*_provider_factory.h` and its provider
//! libraries** - a header ships only where the provider was built and a
//! `onnxruntime_providers_*` library only where one was, while the provider
//! *name strings* are in every build and prove nothing:
//!
//! | package | size | providers |
//! |---|---|---|
//! | `onnxruntime-osx-arm64-1.28.0` | 32 MB | cpu, **coreml**, **webgpu** |
//! | `onnxruntime-win-x64-1.28.0` | 79 MB | cpu |
//! | `onnxruntime-win-arm64-1.28.0` | 80 MB | cpu |
//! | `onnxruntime-linux-x64-1.28.0` | 9 MB | cpu |
//! | `onnxruntime-linux-aarch64-1.28.0` | 8 MB | cpu |
//! | `Microsoft.ML.OnnxRuntime.DirectML` 1.24.4 | 13 MB | cpu, **dml** |
//! | `Microsoft.AI.DirectML` 1.15.4 | 202 MB | *(`DirectML.dll` only)* |
//! | `onnxruntime-win-x64-gpu_cuda12-1.28.0` | 455 MB | cpu, **cuda**, **tensorrt** |
//! | `onnxruntime-win-x64-gpu_cuda13-1.28.0` | 366 MB | cpu, **cuda**, **tensorrt** |
//! | `onnxruntime-linux-x64-gpu_cuda12-1.28.0` | 424 MB | cpu, **cuda**, **tensorrt** |
//! | `onnxruntime-linux-x64-gpu_cuda13-1.28.0` | 241 MB | cpu, **cuda**, **tensorrt** |
//! | `Microsoft.ML.OnnxRuntime.EP.WebGpu` 0.3.0 | 39 MB | **webgpu** *(plugin: win-x64, win-arm64, linux-x64, osx-arm64)* |
//!
//! Those sizes are on the table itself now, as [`Artefact::bytes`], read from
//! each host's `Content-Length` rather than rounded off a directory listing -
//! so the runtime row can say what its download costs before anything is
//! downloaded, and the flavour picker can put the two numbers side by side.
//!
//! So the GPU path differs by platform and neither choice is ours: **macOS gets
//! WebGPU built in, Windows gets DirectML, and the stock Windows and Linux
//! archives get nothing.** DirectML and WebGPU both implement `DFT`, which is
//! the operator that decides whether the inpainter can leave the CPU at all
//! ([`crate::accel`]).
//!
//! ## The WebGPU plugin closes the gap on Windows and Linux
//!
//! From 1.28 the WebGPU provider is also published as a **plugin library**,
//! `Microsoft.ML.OnnxRuntime.EP.WebGpu`, registered into any runtime at
//! 1.24.4 or later ([`crate::runtime::load`] does it), and built for win-x64,
//! win-arm64, linux-x64 and osx-arm64. It is Dawn over Direct3D 12 on Windows
//! and over Vulkan on Linux, so **it reaches NVIDIA, AMD and Intel alike** and
//! is the one provider with a `DFT` kernel that every platform but Linux
//! aarch64 can have. Every Windows and Linux x64 row below carries it as a
//! companion artefact: on the DirectML flavour it is a second `DFT`-capable
//! provider, on the CUDA flavours it is the one that keeps the inpainter on
//! the GPU, and on the stock Linux build it is the whole of the GPU path. On
//! Linux it needs the system Vulkan loader, `libvulkan.so.1`, which every GPU
//! driver package installs and which is not listed under
//! [`Package::user_installed`] for that reason - a machine without it reads
//! `accel.declined.noDevice` rather than being refused the download. macOS
//! does not carry the plugin: its archive has the provider built in, and that
//! is the one that was measured.
//!
//! ## A platform has flavours, and exactly one of them is the default
//!
//! Windows is the platform where "which archive" stopped being one answer.
//! **DirectML is the default and reaches every vendor** - Direct3D 12, so
//! NVIDIA, AMD and Intel alike, nothing for the user to install, and it has the
//! `DFT` kernel, so the inpainter runs on the GPU there the way it does on a
//! Mac. That is the whole of what a Windows machine needs to be as busy as an
//! Apple one.
//!
//! It is not the small download the earlier note claimed, and the arithmetic is
//! worth writing down because it is the one against CUDA: the ONNX Runtime half
//! is 13 MB and `Microsoft.AI.DirectML` is **202 MB**, of which one 18 MB
//! `DirectML.dll` is used - the package carries eight architectures, three of
//! them Xbox. So Windows costs about 215 MB either way and CUDA costs 366–455
//! MB *plus* a toolkit the user installs. Size is therefore the weaker half of
//! the argument; the `DFT` kernel is the whole of it.
//!
//! CUDA is a **second flavour, offered and never chosen for anyone**, which
//! corrects an earlier "declined" without reversing its reasoning. Three
//! facts decide it, all verified by listing the
//! archives rather than inferred:
//!
//! - The CUDA archive's `onnxruntime.dll` is a **different build** from the
//!   DirectML one and carries no `DmlExecutionProvider`. [`crate::runtime::load`]
//!   loads exactly one library, so taking CUDA means giving DirectML up.
//! - CUDA has no `DFT` kernel, so `Automatic` never puts LaMa on it
//!   ([`crate::accel`]). The WebGPU plugin beside it is what keeps the
//!   inpainter on the GPU on that flavour; without the plugin LaMa would be
//!   back on the CPU, which is where it was before the plugin shipped.
//! - It carries `onnxruntime_providers_cuda.dll` and nothing else: **no
//!   `cudart`, no cuDNN**. The user installs those, and
//!   [`crate::accel::Accelerator::availability`] says which is missing.
//!
//! Two CUDA rows rather than one, because ONNX Runtime publishes two and a
//! machine has whichever toolkit it has. Neither has been run here.
//!
//! **Linux x64 has the same three flavours**, for the same reasons: the stock
//! build with the WebGPU plugin is the default and reaches every vendor with
//! nothing to install, and the two CUDA archives are offered to an NVIDIA
//! machine whose owner has the toolkit. Linux aarch64 has the stock build and
//! nothing else - no CUDA archive and no plugin are published for it.
//!
//! Two things still deliberately not taken:
//!
//! - **ROCm, MIGraphX and OpenVINO.** Microsoft publishes no archive carrying
//!   any of them; AMD and Intel ship theirs as Python wheels only. An AMD or
//!   Intel GPU on Linux reaches this application through WebGPU, which is a
//!   real path and the only one there is to download.
//! - **Intel macOS.** 1.28.0 publishes no `osx-x86_64` archive at all. §9 makes
//!   macOS **arm64** the first-release target, so this is consistent rather than
//!   a gap; an Intel Mac would need an older release pinned for it.
//!
//! Nothing here decides what the application *uses*. The running process asks
//! the loaded runtime through [`crate::accel::available`]; this table only
//! decides what to download.
