//! Ingest: what a file is, without decoding it.
//!
//! A `SourceRef` comes from a header-only read, and the policy around it
//! shapes the module. The rule is
//!
//! > Never clean a partially-decoded page.
//!
//! so a file whose header does not parse, or whose pixels do not fully decode,
//! is **skipped and listed** rather than repaired. The listing is the product:
//! a job that silently drops files is worse than one that cleans nothing.
//!
//! **One thing is repaired, and it is a format rather than a file.** A scan
//! folder mostly does not hold PNGs, and refusing every JPEG in it as "not an
//! image this reads" was a true sentence about a folder the user plainly meant
//! to open. [`ingest_paths_importing`] decodes those formats
//! ([`crate::image::foreign`]) and writes a lossless PNG that becomes the page;
//! the original is never opened again and never modified. Everything after the
//! conversion is the same policy over the converted bytes, so there is one
//! sieve and not two.
//!
//! **Every accepted page is taken into the job's own directory, whatever its
//! format was.** A PNG is copied byte for byte and a JPEG is converted, and
//! both come out the far side as a file the library owns with
//! [`SourceRef::converted_from`] naming the user's file. That is what makes a
//! chapter survive its scan folder being deleted, and it is one road rather
//! than two: the import is the last step of accepting a page, so the duplicate
//! check, the stem warning and the manifest row all see the file the rest of
//! the pipeline will open.
//!
//! The user's folder is still the *origin*, and the two questions that turn on
//! it - where an export's `<input>_cleaned/` sibling goes, and which files
//! "output never overwrites input" has to refuse - are answered from
//! `converted_from` rather than from the page's own path.
