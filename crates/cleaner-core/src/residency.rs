//! Where a loaded session actually lives, once nothing is using it.
//!
//! [`crate::registry`] answers *what is resident*; this answers *who is holding
//! it*, and the answer is deliberately not "the run". Until this module existed,
//! every session was a local of the thread that opened it: a [`crate::detect::Detector`]
//! belonged to the run's `Pipeline`, and the four region edits opened their own
//! bench and dropped it at the end of the click. That is correct for memory and
//! wrong for a person - **a model was reloaded for every run, every page turn
//! and every region edit**, and the reload is 2.1 s for rung 2 and ten to sixty
//! seconds for rung 3a.
//!
//! ## The ruling
//!
//! A model, once loaded, stays in memory until **one** of three things happens:
//!
//! - the user presses the close button on its row in the loaded-models tab;
//! - nothing has used it for its kind's own [`crate::registry::Kind::idle_grace`];
//! - the machine is under memory pressure and the pressure ladder takes it
//!   back.
//!
//! Finishing a run is not on that list. Finishing a region edit is not on that
//! list. Turning a page is not on that list.
//!
//! ## Checkout, not sharing
//!
//! A cached session is **moved out** to whoever wants it and moved back when
//! they are done ([`checkout`] and [`checkin`]). Nothing is shared, nothing is
//! locked for the length of an inference, and no session type has to be `Sync`.
//! The property that makes an eviction safe falls out of the same shape: what
//! this module can drop is exactly what is *checked in*, and a session in use is
//! not checked in. **Nothing here can interrupt an inference, because nothing
//! here can reach a session anybody is using.**
//!
//! ## The sweep
//!
//! Idle eviction needs somebody to notice the time. Three things call
//! [`sweep`] and they cover the cases between them:
//!
//! - the tab's own poll, every two seconds while the editor is on screen
//!   (`src-tauri/src/models.rs`);
//! - the run's region boundary, which is where a run already gives sessions back;
//! - a sweeper thread of this module's own, every [`SWEEP_INTERVAL`], so that an
//!   application sitting on the library screen with no editor open still gives
//!   4.6 GB back two minutes after the last click.
//!
//! The sweeper holds no lock while it drops anything: a [`crate::sidecar`] child
//! goes by way of an HTTP shutdown and a kill, and doing that under the table's
//! mutex would stall every other reader for the length of it.
