//! The stitched export: one file for the whole strip, written a row at a time.
//!
//! Rule 8:
//!
//! > **Stitched**: incremental row-wise encoder or tiled TIFF.
//!
//! under rule 1's standing prohibition, which this is the hardest case of:
//!
//! > Nothing concatenates pixels, at any point, including export.
//!
//! So there is no strip buffer here. The writer holds **one page** - the one the
//! rows are currently passing through - composited with the parts of the global
//! patch set that land on it, and drops it when the rows move onto the next.
//! What that page cost is what the stitched export costs, whether the strip is
//! three pages or two hundred, which is the property the whole memory budget
//! exists to keep.
//!
//! ## The gutter is the one thing here that is not a source pixel
//!
//! Pages are centred (rule 1), so a strip whose pages are not all the same
//! width has columns beside the narrow ones that no source file has a pixel
//! for. A stitched file has to put *something* there. This writes **paper
//! white** - every colour channel at its maximum, or at zero for CMYK where
//! zero is no ink, and alpha at zero where the mode has one, so a mode that can
//! say "nothing here" says it rather than inventing a colour.
//!
//! That is an invented pixel either way, and the fidelity contract has
//! nothing to say about it: the contract is stated per source file, and a
//! gutter column
//! is in no source file. So it is **counted** instead -
//! [`Stitched::gutter_pixels`] is how many were written - and an interface that
//! offers stitched output is expected to say so before it runs, exactly as §3
//! requires of every other change the user did not ask for. Per-page export,
//! which is rule 8's default, has no gutter and no such statement to make.
//!
//! ## What it refuses
//!
//! One file has one colour mode, one bit depth and one profile. A strip whose
//! pages disagree about any of those cannot be stitched without converting
//! something, and §2's second clarification - "colour mode is never *upgraded*" -
//! forbids picking the wider of two. Indexed is refused outright: two pages
//! with different palettes would need a reconciled palette, and the
//! nearest-entry snapping that requires is refused.
//!
//! Every one of those is decided from **headers**, before a byte is written. A
//! refusal halfway through leaves a truncated file that looks like a crash.
