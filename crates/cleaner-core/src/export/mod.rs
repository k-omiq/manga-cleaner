//! Turning a page and its patches back into a file.
//!
//! A page with **zero applied patches is copied byte-for-byte**, and
//! passthrough respects the chosen output format rather than leaving one folder
//! holding an untouched 400 KB JPEG beside a cleaned 4 MB PNG.
//!
//! §3: the interface never silently downgrades. When a target format cannot
//! carry the source's mode or depth, the export produces a **declaration** of
//! exactly what will change, and the caller is expected to have shown it before
//! the write.
//!
//! ## Rule 8
//!
//! Rule 8 is "Export streams too", in three parts, and two of them are built here:
//!
//! - **Per-page**, the default: each source is reconstructed at its own
//!   dimensions. [`export_page_to`] is the streaming form - it encodes straight
//!   into the sink instead of building the file as a `Vec<u8>` the caller then
//!   writes, and a passthrough copies the source through without a second
//!   buffer. [`export_page`] is the same thing over a `Vec`, kept because a
//!   caller that wants the bytes should not have to invent a sink.
//! - **Stitched**: [`stitched::export_stitched`], one file for the whole strip,
//!   written a row at a time through [`rows::write_rows`] with one page
//!   resident.
//! - **PSD**: [`psd::write_psd`], reached through [`export_page_psd_to`]. Per
//!   page only - a layered file holds the whole page as its background, which
//!   a strip cannot be.
//!   Written here rather than vendored; the module's own note says why.
//!
//! **A mask file beside the page** - `001.png` and `001_mask.png` - is
//! [`export_mask_to`]: the union of the page's **ink** masks - the lettering
//! each edit removed ([`Patch::ink`]), not the area it painted - as an 8-bit
//! grayscale PNG, white inside. The distinction is the whole file: a balloon
//! rung 0 filled has an applied mask the size of the balloon, and a typesetter
//! asking where the text was does not want the balloon. It is what the seam's
//! `masks: 'separate-layer'` means for a raster format, where the PSD path
//! means a layer mask per region - and *that* mask stays the applied one,
//! because a layer mask says what the layer contributes. Streamed through [`rows::write_rows`] like every
//! other raster here, so the stitched export can write the strip's mask the
//! same way with nothing but the patch set resident.
//!
//! [`cbz`] is a fourth thing and deliberately not a fourth encoder: a CBZ is
//! the per-page files, unaltered, inside a zip. It is the one path that holds a
//! page's encoded file whole rather than streaming it, because a stored zip
//! entry states its own CRC and length before its data; that module's note is
//! where the memory argument for it lives.
//!
//! Rule 8's remaining sentence - a patch spanning a join is split at the page
//! boundary, and the passthrough test is a per-page **intersection** with the
//! global patch set rather than patch ownership - is [`split`], and that module
//! is where the reasoning for it lives.
