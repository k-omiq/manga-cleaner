//! Rule 8's other half: a patch that spans a join, written into two files.
//!
//! Rule 1 settles the pair of decisions this module implements one of:
//!
//! > Resolution: read across verified joins, split the **patch** at export, and
//! > require the two halves to share a fill tone with no visible seam.
//!
//! and rule 8 states the consequence for the passthrough test:
//!
//! > A patch spanning a join is split at the page boundary, and the passthrough
//! > test uses per-page **intersection** with the global patch set, not patch
//! > ownership.
//!
//! The fidelity contract says the same thing from its own side, and it is
//! the sentence that explains why ownership is not merely a worse answer
//! but a wrong one: a patch
//! that spans a join **belongs to no single page**. Ask "which page owns this
//! patch" and one of the two pages it writes into answers "none of mine", is
//! declared untouched, and is copied byte-for-byte - while the other page's
//! file carries half a bubble. The page's file is then bit-identical to its
//! source and *wrong*, which is the one failure the fidelity contract cannot
//! see, because the contract is an upper bound on what may change and a
//! passthrough changes nothing.
//!
//! ## How the two sides are made to agree
//!
//! By never computing anything. [`StripPatch::split_at_joins`] is a **copy**:
//! every sample of every part is one sample of the strip-coordinate patch,
//! moved. There is no resampling, no re-fit, no per-page ring statistic and no
//! second call to an engine, so there is no arithmetic that could round one way
//! above the join and the other way below it. The fill tone is shared because
//! it is the *same tone*, written twice.
//!
//! The copy is per **sample** rather than per row, and that is load-bearing
//! rather than cautious. Pages are centred (rule 1), so a page narrower than
//! the strip sits at an x offset - and at 1, 2 or 4 bits per sample an odd
//! offset puts the page's first sample in the middle of a byte. A row-wise
//! `copy_from_slice` would shift every sample on the narrower page by a
//! fraction of a byte, which is a corruption that looks like a colour shift.
