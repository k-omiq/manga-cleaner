//! The incremental encoders rule 8 asks for.
//!
//! Rule 8 is one sentence long about the mechanism:
//!
//! > **Stitched**: incremental row-wise encoder or tiled TIFF.
//!
//! This module is both halves of it. A caller supplies a [`Canvas`], which
//! is everything a file needs about an image *except* its pixels, and a function
//! that fills one row at a time. Nothing here ever holds the image.
//!
//! That matters for the stitched case, where the image is the whole strip and
//! rule 1 forbids ever having it:
//!
//! > Nothing concatenates pixels, at any point, including export.
//!
//! It is used for the per-page case too, and there the win is smaller but real:
//! [`crate::export::export_page`] builds the encoded file as a `Vec<u8>` which
//! the caller then writes, so the file exists twice; the streaming form encodes
//! straight into the sink.
//!
//! ## Why this is not in `crate::image`
//!
//! `image::encode` takes a whole [`Raster`] and returns a whole `Vec<u8>`, which
//! is the right shape for a page and the wrong one for a strip. A row-wise
//! encoder is a different interface rather than an option on that one, and it is
//! the export path's own need. `crate::image` was also being edited in parallel
//! when this landed; the two PNG paths share the `iCCP`/`sRGB` ordering rule
//! and nothing else, and if they are ever unified it should be by moving
//! `image::encode` onto this rather than the other way round.
