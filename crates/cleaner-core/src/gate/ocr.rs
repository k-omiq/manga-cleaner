//! `manga-ocr`, read as a **rescue** rather than as the gate.
//!
//! This model was rejected as the gate and the reason still holds: its output
//! vocabulary is Japanese, so it cannot say *not Japanese*, and a gate that can
//! only ever answer one way is not a gate. What it can do is answer the
//! narrower question
//! [`crate::gate::ScriptGate`] is left with when the script identifier reads a
//! line and comes back with nothing usable - *is there Japanese in this
//! balloon?* - and on that question a reader whose whole vocabulary is Japanese
//! is exactly the right instrument. Which regions it is allowed near is decided
//! in [`super`], not here.
//!
//! ## The model
//!
//! `kha-white/manga-ocr-base`, Apache-2.0: a ViT encoder over a 224² crop and a
//! two-layer BERT decoder over a 6144-entry character vocabulary
//! (`cl-tohoku/bert-base-japanese-char-v2`). The ONNX export is
//! `mayocream/manga-ocr-onnx` - the same author as `lama-manga.onnx` - and is
//! two files, 343.5 MB and 117.5 MB, opened as two sessions and registered as
//! one row.
//!
//! The tensor contract, read off the files with `spikes/onnx-probe` rather than
//! taken from the card:
//!
//! ```text
//! encoder  in  pixel_values          float32[batch, channels, height, width]
//!          out last_hidden_state     float32[batch, 197, 768]
//! decoder  in  input_ids             int64  [batch, tokens]
//!              encoder_hidden_states float32[batch, 197, 768]
//!          out logits                float32[batch, tokens, 6144]
//! ```
//!
//! ## The preprocessing is a squish, and that is not a bug
//!
//! From the export's own `preprocessor_config.json` and the reference
//! implementation (`CodeMonkeyNinja/manga-ocr-rs`, MIT): grey, then replicated
//! to three channels, then resized to **224×224 with no regard for aspect
//! ratio**, then `0..1` and `(v − 0.5) / 0.5`. A tall kana column is squashed
//! into a square and the model was trained that way, so preserving the aspect
//! ratio here - the obvious "fix" - is what would break it.
//!
//! ## Greedy, and capped
//!
//! The reference decodes with four beams and `no_repeat_ngram_size = 3`. This
//! decodes greedily and stops at 64 tokens, because the question asked of the
//! reading is *is it Japanese*, not *what does it say*: a beam search buys
//! fidelity on the characters, and the caller only counts them by block. The
//! export carries no past-key-value inputs, so each step re-runs the whole
//! prefix - which is what makes the cap matter, and 64 characters is more than
//! a balloon holds.
