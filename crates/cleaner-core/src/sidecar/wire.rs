//! The shapes that cross the socket, and the error taxonomy they carry.
//!
//! Every type here is one JSON document in [`super`]'s protocol, named for the
//! endpoint it belongs to. The protocol itself - endpoints, statuses, when each
//! error kind is correct - is documented once, in [`super`], because a reader
//! implementing the Python half needs it as prose and not as a list of structs.
//!
//! ## Why the pixels are raw bytes and not a PNG
//!
//! An [`Image`] is base64 over **interleaved 8-bit samples**, with the width,
//! the height and the channel count stated beside them. No codec is named on
//! the wire at all.
//!
//! That is the one decision in this file worth defending, because a PNG would
//! be a third the size. It is refused because a PNG carries a
//! colour mode, a bit depth, a palette, a `tRNS` chunk, an ICC profile and an
//! sRGB intent, and every one of them is a thing the two halves of this
//! protocol could disagree about silently. libvips was reversed from this
//! project over exactly one such
//! disagreement - `spngload.c` destroying the palette at load. A sidecar
//! written in a language whose imaging library "helpfully" promotes grayscale
//! to RGB, or attaches a working-space profile on save, would return pixels
//! that composite wrong in a way no test in this repository would catch,
//! because the page would still be the right size and roughly the right colour.
//!
//! Raw samples cannot carry any of that. The page's own mode, depth, palette
//! and profile never leave this process: [`crate::engines::flux`] converts to
//! 8-bit RGB on the way out and writes the answer back into the page's own
//! samples on the way in, which is the same discipline
//! [`crate::engines::model`] applies to a tensor. What the sidecar sees is a
//! rectangle of numbers.
//!
//! The cost is bandwidth, and over loopback it is not a cost: a 768² crop is
//! 1.7 MB of samples and 2.4 MB once base64 has taken its third, against a
//! render that is budgeted ten to sixty
//! seconds for.
