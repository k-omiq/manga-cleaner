//! Which allocator each backend actually uses, and what bounding it means
//! there.
//!
//! Rule 9's first guard is the
//! one the reference implementation broke three times over, and its conclusion
//! is a sentence about *naming*: **"a guard that does not name its backend is a
//! guard for one backend. Adding a backend means adding its bound, or refusing
//! to offer it."** This module is that sentence as a table. **Three** backends
//! are in scope, no two of them share an allocator, and nothing here is written
//! in a way that could quietly apply to more than one.
//!
//! ## What went wrong in the reference, restated as requirements
//!
//! The reference implementation had four guards that were each
//! correct for the backend they were written against and silently absent
//! everywhere else. Read from this side they are four *names*, and every one of
//! them is in [`Contract::required`] for the backend it belongs to:
//!
//! | What was missing | The name here | The backend it is real on |
//! |---|---|---|
//! | `mx.set_memory_limit` had no caller | `mx.set_memory_limit` | `mflux` only - MLX |
//! | `mx.set_cache_limit` had no caller, so the buffer cache was unbounded | `mx.set_cache_limit` | `mflux` only |
//! | VAE tiling applied through an attribute the MLX inpainter does not expose | `vae_tiling` | `sdcpp` only - see below |
//! | the Qwen3-4B text encoder was never evicted after encoding | `text_encoder_eviction` | `sdcpp` only - see below |
//!
//! The two that are `mflux` only are the two whose *units* are MLX's. The two
//! below them are behaviours rather than byte counts, and each backend reaches
//! them by its own route - `stable-diffusion.cpp` through `--vae-tiling` and
//! `--clip-on-cpu`. The wire names them backend-neutrally for exactly that
//! reason: what this process requires is the *effect*, and which call produces
//! it is the sidecar's business.
//!
//! ## Why `mflux` no longer requires either behaviour
//!
//! Both were required of it and both have been withdrawn, on separate
//! measurements and for the same rule - **a guard a backend cannot promise for
//! every render is a guard it must not echo**, which is the earlier finding
//! read forwards instead of backwards.
//!
//! - `text_encoder_eviction` was applied by `mflux`'s `MemorySaver`, which nulls
//!   the text encoder before the denoising loop and cannot rebuild it. FLUX.2
//!   re-encodes the prompt on every call, so the *second* render through one
//!   open threw. The rung worked
//!   around that by reopening the model per region; the encoder is now kept
//!   instead, and what pays for it is an honest declaration - the sidecar
//!   declares 10 GiB of working set against 9.77 GB, which is what the largest
//!   shape its untiled arm can reach actually measured.
//! - `vae_tiling` helps a large crop's decode spike and **hurts a small one**:
//!   `mflux` tiles the encode above 512 px and the decode above a 512 px output,
//!   blending tiles with a cosine ramp, which is a seam across exactly the
//!   working resolution the sidecar now upscales small crops to. It is therefore
//!   applied per render, on the crop, and a per-render decision cannot be echoed
//!   at open as though it held for all of them.
//!
//! What bounds `mflux` is what is left: the two MLX setters - one of which
//! is recorded as a guideline rather than a wall - and the parent's per-region
//! peak check, which is [`Cap::Parent`]'s bound doing double duty on a backend
//! that also has setters.
//!
//! ## The three shapes a bound comes in
//!
//! MLX has a pair of setters, torch has a fraction, and ggml has nothing, and
//! pretending otherwise is how the reference ended up capping torch on a
//! torch-free path. So [`Cap`] has three variants and the differences are
//! stated rather than smoothed over. What makes the last one a bound and not a
//! hope is that **the parent enforces it in every case**: the sidecar reports
//! its peak on every reply, and [`super::Client::render`] refuses and shuts the
//! child down when that peak passes the budget. For `mflux` and `sdnq` that is a
//! second line of defence behind a setter; for `stable-diffusion.cpp` it is the
//! only one, and saying so is the point.
//!
//! ## `sdnq` is the portable arm, and the earlier guard finally lands on torch
//!
//! §4a reopened this rung for the machine with a discrete GPU, and that machine
//! cannot run a line of MLX. [`Backend::Sdnq`] is `torch` + `diffusers` with
//! `sdnq`'s 4-bit weights: CUDA, Intel XPU or Metal, which is every platform
//! this application builds for. Two guards, and each is real on every device it
//! will accept:
//!
//! - **[`MEMORY_FRACTION`]** - `torch.cuda.set_per_process_memory_fraction` and
//!   `torch.mps.set_per_process_memory_fraction`. It bounds *reserved* memory,
//!   which is the live allocations and the caching allocator's cache **together** -
//!   so rule 9's second guard, "cap the cache, do not only purge it", is met
//!   by this one knob rather than by a second one torch does not have. That is
//!   why [`Cap::Fraction`] names one setter and not two, and why requiring a
//!   cache name here would be the reference's error in a new place.
//!
//!   `PYTORCH_MPS_HIGH_WATERMARK_RATIO` is this call's ancestor. The
//!   complaint there was never that the guard was wrong; it was that it was
//!   aimed at an allocator that was not in the inference path. On this backend
//!   torch *is* the inference path.
//! - **[`CPU_OFFLOAD`]** - `diffusers`' `enable_model_cpu_offload`, or
//!   `enable_sequential_cpu_offload` where the accelerator cannot hold one
//!   component. One component on the device at a time, the rest on the host.
//!
//! **And the two behaviours `sdcpp` requires are deliberately not required of
//! it**, on the same rule that withdrew them from `mflux`. `vae_tiling` seams a
//! crop at the working resolution a small region is upscaled into, because
//! `diffusers` tiles above its VAE's own sample threshold and that threshold is
//! below 768. `text_encoder_eviction` is not a *second* promise: the offload
//! hook is what performs it - `diffusers` moves the encoder back to the host
//! after encoding and moves it out again next call, which is the behaviour
//! `mflux` was found unable to repeat - so it is [`CPU_OFFLOAD`] under another
//! name, and naming one behaviour twice makes an echo look richer than it is.
//!
//! **A machine with no accelerator is refused rather than served.** With no
//! CUDA, XPU or Metal device there is nothing to offload to and no fraction to
//! set, so the sidecar answers `501 unbounded_backend` at open instead of
//! echoing guards it did not apply. A 4B transformer at four bits on a CPU is
//! minutes per step; the refusal costs nothing anybody wanted, and it is a
//! *decline* into rung 2 rather than a fault.
//!
//! ## What is deliberately not here
//!
//! **An address-space rlimit on the child.** It is the obvious way to bound a
//! host-heap allocator from the outside without the child's cooperation, and it
//! is wrong: `RLIMIT_AS` counts reserved virtual address space, which a modern
//! allocator takes in tens of gigabytes it never faults in, so a limit sized to
//! this rung's budget would kill a process that is nowhere near it. A guard
//! that fires on a number unrelated to residency is the earlier mistake in a
//! new place, and the remedy is the peak check above,
//! which is measured in the same units the budget is.
