//! Talking to the sidecar, and owning the process that answers.
//!
//! Two values, because two things are being owned and only one of them is
//! always ours. [`Client`] is the protocol against an address: it knows the
//! token, the contract, the budget and the deadline, and it has no idea whether
//! anything is a child of this process. [`Sidecar`] is a [`Client`] with a
//! [`std::process::Child`] behind it, spawned here and killed on drop.
//!
//! The split is not tidiness. It is what makes rung 3a testable on a machine
//! with no Python at all - [`crate::engines::flux`]'s tests stand a
//! [`std::net::TcpListener`] up in a thread, speak the protocol back, and drive
//! a real region through a real composite. And it is what lets a developer run
//! the Python half by hand: [`Sidecar::attach`] takes an address and a token
//! and spawns nothing, which is the only way to debug a sidecar under a
//! debugger of its own.
//!
//! ## What is enforced here rather than asked for
//!
//! Rule 9 is a contract on a
//! process we did not write, so most of it can only be *checked* from this
//! side. Three things are genuinely enforced here:
//!
//! - **The open fails when a required guard was not applied.** The sidecar
//!   echoes what it did; [`super::backend::Contract::satisfied_by`] compares
//!   that against the backend's own list; a short echo shuts the child down. A
//!   sidecar that quietly skipped `mx.set_cache_limit` - exactly this failure -
//!   does not get to run a region.
//! - **The peak is checked after every region, against the budget.** This is
//!   the whole of the bound for a backend whose allocator has no setter
//!   ([`super::backend::Cap::Parent`]) and the second line of defence for one
//!   that does. Over the cap, the child is shut down and the region declines to
//!   rung 2 - rule 9's third guard, one region later than an allocator would
//!   have managed it, and still into the ladder rather than into the
//!   compressor.
//! - **One region in flight.** [`Client::render`] takes `&mut self`, so the
//!   type system holds rule 6 on this side; the protocol holds it on the other
//!   by answering `409 busy` rather than queueing.
//!
//! ## The floor between regions is measured, not assumed
//!
//! Rule 9's last guard ends *"if it ratchets instead, it is not honouring this
//! document and the rung is not shippable. That is a measurement, not an
//! assumption."* [`Floor`] is the seam that measurement goes through: every
//! reply's memory block is recorded, the first and last resident readings are
//! kept, and [`Floor::ratchet`] is the difference. Nothing here fails a run on
//! a ratchet, because what "flat" means in bytes is exactly the constant this
//! file will not invent. What is built is the instrument.
