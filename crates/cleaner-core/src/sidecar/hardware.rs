//! Rung 3a's hardware gate: §4a's arithmetic,
//! against [`crate::memory`]'s answers.
//!
//! The gate for the two
//! in-process rungs was closed earlier, leaving this rung's own ceiling as a
//! residue - *"rung
//! 3a's own hardware gate is still not built … §4a's ceiling has no
//! implementation, because the rung it gates does not exist"*. The rung exists
//! now, so this is that ceiling.
//!
//! ## The arithmetic, and where each term comes from
//!
//! §4a writes it as three subtractions:
//!
//! ```text
//! budget = 0.75 × physical RAM
//!        − the resident cleaner (02's table)
//!        − headroom for the webview and the OS
//! ```
//!
//! Two of the three are already answered by [`crate::memory`], and answering
//! them a second time here is how a budget that existed twice, corrected in
//! one copy, happened. So:
//!
//! **`0.75 × physical RAM`, less the webview, is [`crate::memory::room`].** It
//! is the lesser of what the platform will grant at all
//! ([`crate::memory::Machine::process_ceiling`]) and what is actually going
//! spare right now ([`crate::memory::available`]), each already less
//! [`crate::memory::WEBVIEW_BYTES`]. Note that the fraction there is **two
//! thirds and not three quarters**, deliberately: `memory`'s own documentation
//! records that 21 GB of 32 is the low end of §4a's stated 21–24 GB range and
//! that a gate takes the low end of a range it did not measure.
//!
//! **The resident cleaner is [`RESIDENT_CLEANER`]**, and it is a citation
//! rather than a number invented here.
//!
//! **The OS headroom is already paid, twice, and this file does not invent a
//! constant for it.** Once by the fraction: two thirds of 32 GB is 21.33 GB
//! against three quarters' 24 GB, so the gate has already set aside 2.67 GB
//! that §4a's formula would have spent. And once by `available()`, which is the
//! kernel's own `memorystatus_level` and therefore *is* the OS's current
//! occupancy rather than an allowance for it. A fourth subtraction on top would
//! be a number nobody measured, sitting in front of a rung whose whole problem
//! is that its demand is unmeasured too. Recorded as a deferral rather than
//! guessed at.
//!
//! ## Weights are the floor and never the budget
//!
//! Rule 9's fourth guard is enforced by the shape of [`Demand`]: it has two
//! fields, neither is optional, and there is no constructor that takes weights
//! alone. A backend that reports `weights_bytes` and no `working_set_bytes` is
//! **refused** - [`Decline::SidecarUnbounded`] - because the alternative is to
//! gate on the floor, which §4a says in as many words will "admit machines that
//! then thrash".
//!
//! The gate also refuses a declared working set *below* the weights. A model
//! cannot hold its own parameters and less than its own parameters at once, so
//! such a declaration is a sidecar that has not understood the field, and the
//! remedy is not to believe it.
//!
//! ## A backend with no render path here is declined first, and for that reason
//!
//! The gate's **first** question is not about memory at all: does the backend
//! this run is going to ask for render on this platform, in this build? It is
//! asked before the memory questions because it does not depend on their
//! answers, and the refusal is [`Decline::SidecarPlatform`] - *this build has no
//! FLUX sidecar for this kind of computer*.
//!
//! **What that question now means has changed, because the answer used to be
//! "no" for two whole platforms.** Rung 3a shipped with one rendering backend,
//! `mflux`, which is MLX, which is Apple Silicon; `sdcpp` was declared and
//! returned 501. So Windows and
//! Linux were refused outright - the platforms §4a reopened the rung *for*.
//! [`super::backend::Backend::Sdnq`] is the answer to that: torch and
//! `diffusers`, which build everywhere, so **no platform is refused for want of
//! a backend any more**. [`platform_decline`] therefore answers `None` on every
//! shipped build, and it is still computed from
//! [`super::backend::Backend::offered`] rather than replaced by a `None`,
//! because a backend removed from the table has to change the answer.
//!
//! What survives is the *per-backend* form, [`platform_decline_for`]: a user who
//! chooses `mflux` in Settings on a Windows machine has chosen something that
//! cannot run, and the honest reply names their choice rather than their memory.
//! Whether the chosen backend's Python packages are actually installed is a
//! different question with a different remedy, and it is the sidecar's to answer -
//! [`super::wire::Health::backends`], checked in
//! [`crate::engines::flux::Inpainter::open`].
//!
//! **That correction still stands underneath all of this.** Those platforms
//! used to be declined under [`Decline::SidecarUnknownMachine`], because
//! [`crate::memory::room`] answered `None` there and the unclassifiable arm
//! caught them. A probe closed that: `room` answers on both now, so what
//! reaches that arm is a probe that was made and failed.
//!
//! ## An unclassifiable machine is declined, and that is not obviously right
//!
//! [`crate::memory::room`] answers `None` where a probe was made and failed -
//! a sysctl, a `/proc` read that would not read, a `GlobalMemoryStatusEx` that
//! returned false - and on a platform with no probe at all. This gate declines
//! that machine. Four reasons, and then the argument against, which is real:
//!
//! - **The two gates' worst cases are not comparable.**
//!   [`crate::accel::choose_within`] honours a forced provider when it has no
//!   memory answer, and it is right to: underneath it sits a measured automatic
//!   choice, and the cost of being wrong is a slow run or a session that fails
//!   to build. Underneath this one sits an out-of-process child that
//!   was observed reaching 25 GB, and the
//!   cost of being wrong is the machine.
//! - **§4a asks for a positive answer, not the absence of a negative one.** The
//!   rung is "gated on detected hardware"; hardware that was not detected has
//!   not passed a gate.
//! - **Declining costs the user nothing they had.** The rung is absent by
//!   default and ships no weights; a machine that is declined is in the state
//!   every machine is in until someone installs something.
//! - **It is declined *with a reason*.** §4a's requirement is that "the gate
//!   reports what it found, so a user whose machine is declined is told why
//!   rather than shown a control that fails", and
//!   [`Decline::SidecarUnknownMachine`] is a different sentence from
//!   [`Decline::SidecarMachine`] precisely so the two remedies stay apart.
//!
//! **The objection it used to carry is now nobody's.** This paragraph once read
//! "against: this declines Windows and Linux, and those are exactly the
//! platforms §4a reopened the rung for". The probe gave both of them a `room`
//! figure, and then the backend refusal above stopped them anyway; the thing
//! owed to §4a's discrete-GPU case was a backend that runs there, and
//! [`super::backend::Backend::Sdnq`] is it. What is left in this arm is the case
//! it was always meant for: a machine whose own kernel would not say how much
//! memory it has.
