//! Rung 2 - manga-finetuned LaMa, the default inpainter.
//!
//! The rung that exists for
//! what rungs 0 and 1 cannot reconstruct: screentone, halftone and line art
//! behind the text, where a plane is a hole and a bilateral filter is a smear.
//!
//! ## What the model actually is, and what it wanted
//!
//! `lama-manga.onnx`, opset 17, one input pair and one output:
//!
//! ```text
//! image  Float32[batch, 3, 512, 512]
//! mask   Float32[batch, 1, 512, 512]
//! output Float32[batch, 3, 512, 512]
//! ```
//!
//! Four properties of that contract were **measured against the file** rather
//! than taken from the upstream convention. The ladder carried a second
//! inpainter at the time - MI-GAN, since removed - and it disagreed with this
//! one about three of the four, which is what made measuring rather than
//! assuming the point. A wrong guess here is not an error; it is a plausible
//! image with the background destroyed:
//!
//! - **The value range is 0..1.** Fed the same crop scaled to 0..255, the model
//!   returns a tensor whose mean is 1.000 and whose reconstruction error inside
//!   the hole is 0.74 in 0..1 units against 0.064 for the same crop at 0..1.
//!   It saturates; it does not rescale.
//! - **The mask's polarity is 1 = hole**, LaMa's own convention. With the mask
//!   inverted the error *outside* the hole goes from 0.010 to 0.743 - the model
//!   faithfully repaints the whole page and leaves the text alone, which is the
//!   failure this measurement exists to rule out.
//! - **Channels come back in the order they went in.** A crop whose red channel
//!   was darkened to 0.4× returns with channel 0 at mean 0.305 against 0.746 and
//!   0.748 on the other two. There is no BGR swap in the export.
//! - **The graph masks the image itself.** Feeding the crop with the text still
//!   in it and feeding the same crop with the masked region zeroed produce
//!   **bit-identical** output, so `image × (1 − mask)` is inside the exported
//!   graph. This module zeroes anyway: the zeroing is per *tile*, and a tile's
//!   mask is deliberately smaller than the region's, so relying on the graph
//!   would tie the tiling scheme below to a property of one export.
//!
//! And the fifth measurement, which is the one the compositor is built around:
//! **the model alters pixels it was never asked to touch.** Against a
//! ground-truth crop, the returned samples outside the mask are off by a mean
//! of 8.0 8-bit levels within 5 px of the hole, 3.4 at 6–16 px, and **2.5 levels
//! even 65 px away and further**, with a single worst sample at 88 levels. 68.6%
//! of all out-of-mask samples move by at least one level. That is why
//! the contract is enforced
//! by *writing through a mask* rather than by trusting a model, and why
//! [`Rendered::pixels`] carries the page's own pixels everywhere the mask does
//! not reach.
//!
//! ## Sessions are held and regions are not batched
//!
//! [`Inpainter`] owns a session for its whole life. Building costs seconds
//! and running costs one, so a session rebuilt per region would spend most of
//! the job in the loader. Batching is the optimisation that is **not** here and
//! must not be added - manga-LaMa's only dynamic axis is `batch`, the spatial
//! input is fixed at 512², and per-region cost is flat to batch 4 and worse
//! above it. There is no batching
//! path to build, which is the useful half of that result.
//!
//! ## Geometry: padding, tiling, and where the pixels come from
//!
//! > Padding to 512: only ever with **real surrounding page pixels**, and where
//! > the crop abuts the true page edge, **edge-replicate** - never reflection.
//!
//! `page` is whatever raster the caller decoded - in the pipeline it is a
//! decode window (rule 4), which
//! is sized to contain a 512² engine context and is clamped to the owning page
//! rectangle. So this module's "page edge" and rule 4's are the same edge, and
//! [`EdgePad::Replicate`] is recorded exactly when the clamp bit.
//!
//! Above 512 the region is tiled, and the tiling is where rule 4's second
//! sentence earns its place:
//!
//! > Box > 512 → **tile the mask with 128 px overlap**, run each tile against
//! > the running composite, and blend inside the isolation margin.
//!
//! Tiles are laid out in raster order and each one **commits only its core** -
//! the crop less half the overlap on any side another tile still follows. The
//! next tile therefore opens with 64 px of already-inpainted page as ordinary
//! unmasked context and fills onward from it. That is what "against the running
//! composite" buys: without it two neighbouring tiles invent two continuations
//! of the same screentone independently and the overlap is a cross-fade between
//! two guesses rather than one fill carried across.
//!
//! A tile's **hole**, though, is not cut at its commit. It is cut at what has
//! already been filled, which is a different line and the difference is the
//! whole point: the mask does not stop at the core, so the text in the hand-off
//! band sits inside the same crop, and a hole that stopped at the commit
//! boundary would leave that text in the tensor as context for the model to
//! read and continue back into the pixels the tile does keep. Measured at 254
//! 8-bit levels of dependence on pixels the mask exists to erase, against 0 on
//! every untiled region of the same page. The removed rung 3 stated the same
//! rule from the other side, and stated it first; this is now the only
//! statement of it.
//!
//! Past four model inputs - 2048 px in either dimension - the region is
//! [`Decline`]d rather than tiled. Twenty-five sequential model runs is not a
//! long wait, it is a different product, and the rule holds: leaving text is
//! recoverable and a bad fill is not.
//!
//! ## What this rung refuses outright
//!
//! Rungs 2-4
//! are disabled
//! for indexed and CMYK sources, and [`ColorMode::allows_model_engines`] is
//! that rule. Bitonal is this module's own addition: a 1-bit sample is not
//! a level, so continuous-tone output
//! written into one is a per-pixel threshold - the nearest-entry snapping
//! that is refused, in two colours. Rung 1 was
//! generalised from "skipped for bitonal sources" to the same shape, and
//! declining is
//! the conservative half of an undecided question.
//!
//! ## Where the geometry went
//!
//! The tiling, the applied mask, the write bound, the decline vocabulary and
//! the isolation ramp are **not in this file**. They were lifted into
//! [`crate::engines::model`] when rung 3 arrived, because rule 4 names one
//! engine context for both model rungs and a second copy of that number would
//! eventually disagree with this one. Everything this module used to export
//! under its own name it still exports, by re-export, so the rung's public
//! surface is unchanged; what is left below is the part that is genuinely
//! manga-LaMa's - a float32 tensor pair, `1 = hole`, and a graph that masks its
//! own input.

/// stops it, and the table below stands as what was true of the synthetic
/// fixtures it was measured on. This function still adds nothing, for the

/// the composite then hands straight back. The measurement below is unaffected
/// and points the same way - the whole of it says that a hole **wider** than the
/// set being written is worse, and `ink` is the narrowest statement of that set
/// this pipeline has.
///
/// Stated as a function rather than left implicit at the one place that reads
/// it, because the opposite is what the removed rung 3 did - it grew its hole
/// by a fixed margin - and the difference is worth having written down rather
/// than inferred from an absence.
///
/// It is not a widened hole because a **measurement says a widened hole is
/// worse**, and it is worth being exact about what was asked and what came
/// back, since the reasoning that suggests widening is sound and only the
/// premise is wrong.
///
/// The suggestion is that an inpainter generates content consistent with the
/// boundary it is given, so a hole with the silhouette of the glyphs invites
/// the model to draw a glyph - which would make the leftover stroke-shaped
/// marks this rung produces the hole's own fault. Seven geometries were run
/// against one held session on each of the eleven regions of
/// `fixtures/pages/page-crowded.png` that route here: this one, the fitted mask
/// grown by 8 px and by 16 px, its filled convex hull, its filled bounding box,
/// and two edge-constrained variants that flood outward from the mask and stop
/// at [`crate::fit::EdgeMap`]'s strong edges. Counting the pixels left more than
/// 64 levels under the region's own paper inside the written set, against 1,143
/// to 4,736 before the edit:
///
/// | Region | this hole | ⊕ 8 px |
