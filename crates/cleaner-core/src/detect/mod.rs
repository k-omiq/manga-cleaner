//! Detection: text boxes and a per-pixel mask.
//!
//! `comic_text_detector` returns three tensors and we use two of them - the
//! YOLO head and the segmentation mask. The mask is why this model is worth
//! its GPL-3.0 obligation and why it is **retained** past the auto pass.
//!
//! Two rules from Phase 0 spike 6:
//!
//! - **Bind the outputs by channel count, not by index.** Upstream carries a
//!   defensive swap for exports that reverse `seg` and `det`, and the count is
//!   what tells them apart: the mask has one channel, the lines map has two.
//! - **The two box classes are languages**, `eng` and `ja`, not bubble kinds,
//!   and upstream annotates them `# cls could give wrong result`. They are
//!   carried through as a weak signal and nothing routes on them alone.
