//!
//! | Tier | Built by | Used for |
//! |---|---|---|
//! | `tight` | detector output → centre-in-box merge → +2 all sides, +3 right | crops, tight reference |
//! | `extended` | after filtering → +5 all sides | drawn into the box mask |
//! | `masking` | merged at >20% of the smaller box's area | the masking box |
//! | `reference` | merged, +20 px | the base cutout rings are sampled from, and the paste origin |
