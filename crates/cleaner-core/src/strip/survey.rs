//! The pass that turns rules 1–3's geometry into something a run can hold.
//!
//! Rules 1-3's geometry was built and had no caller. This is the caller.
//! One walk over the pages, in
//! order, keeping **one page of samples and two row-strips**, and what comes
//! back is everything the clean pass needs to know about the strip before it
//! reads a single decode window:
//!
//! - which joins may be read across ([`check_join`], [`Joins`]) - and, for the
//!   ones that may not, what was wrong with them, so they can be reported;
//! - where the strip is split ([`plan_splits`]), recorded in `strip.splits`;
//! - what the detection segments are ([`detection_segments`]).
//!
//! ## The shape is rule 1's, deliberately
//!
//! Nothing here holds two pages. The join check reads [`JOIN_PROBE_ROWS`] rows
//! either side of one boundary, so the previous page survives this walk as
//! sixteen rows of luma; the row profile is one `f32` per strip row, which is
//! 3.2 MB for a 200-page webtoon. A survey of a 200-page chapter costs one page
//! of pixels at a time, and that is the whole of the memory argument rule 1
//! exists to make.
//!
//! ## Two things this does not do, named rather than left to be found
//!
//! **The mask term of rule 2's row score is not added here.** Rule 2 asks for
//! "coverage by the detector's mask from a cheap low-resolution pre-pass", and
//! there is no cheap pre-pass: the only thing in this build that can say where
//! text is, is the detector, and running it here would be a second inference
//! over every page. [`RowProfile::add_mask_coverage`] is written, tested, and
//! still has no caller. What that costs is real and bounded - a balloon's
//! interior is flat paper, so the gradient term alone can pick a row inside a
//! bubble - and it is bounded because rule 3's detection overlap is what
//! recovers a box a split cut.
//!
//! **The detection overlap stops at a page boundary.** [`detection_segments`]
//! extends a segment's detection range 900 rows into the next segment's work;
//! [`Survey`] then caps that range at the end of the page the segment starts
//! in, because the reader this build has is a page-at-a-time reader and a
//! detection range that crossed a join would need two pages resident. Inside a
//! tall page - the webtoon case, where a source is 800×12000 and rule 2 cuts it
//! into six segments - the overlap is unaffected and does its whole job. Across
//! a **page join** it does not fire, so a bubble split across one is still two
//! boxes to the detector even where [`Strip::clamp`] would let the read cross.
