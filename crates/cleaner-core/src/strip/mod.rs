//! Longstrip geometry: the virtual stitch, the split plan, and the global box
//! list.
//!
//! Longstrip rules 1, 2 and 3. One module rather than three, because the
//! three rules share one coordinate system and separating them is how a box
//! ends up measured in one space and owned in another.
//!
//! The rule that shapes everything here is rule 1's first sentence:
//!
//! > A `Strip` is an ordered list of `SourceRef`s with cumulative offsets - a
//! > coordinate system, not a buffer.
//!
//! So [`Strip`] holds page **placements** and no pixels at all. Nothing in this
//! module takes a whole strip's worth of samples: the join check reads a few
//! rows either side of one boundary ([`join`]), the split plan accumulates one
//! `f32` per strip row from one page at a time ([`split`]), and the box merge
//! works on rectangles ([`segment`]).
//!
//! ## Rules 4 to 6, and what they call
//!
//! [`window`] is rule 4 - the per-box decode window, every term native.
//! [`stream`] is rule 6 - one window in flight, results streamed out.
//! [`survey`] is the caller rules 1-3's geometry needed: one
//! walk over the pages that probes every join with [`check_join`], accumulates
//! rule 2's row profile a page at a time, and answers with the [`Joins`], the
//! [`plan_splits`] plan and the [`detection_segments`] segments a clean pass
//! needs before it reads anything.
//!
//! `src-tauri/src/run.rs` calls [`survey`] once per job, emits the one join
//! anomaly the catalogue has a sentence for, and writes the plan into the
//! manifest's `strip.splits`; the run's pipeline detects per segment, decides
//! ownership on [`merge_global`]'s global list, and bounds every read with
//! [`window::decode_window`], which ends in [`Strip::clamp`].
//!
//! **What still has no caller**, so that no "is" here is read as more than it
//! says: [`RowProfile::add_mask_coverage`], because rule 2's "cheap
//! low-resolution pre-pass" does not exist and the detector is the only thing
//! that knows where text is. The detection overlap is capped at a page boundary
//! by [`Survey`] - see that module's note for what that costs.
//!
//! [`Strip::split_at_joins`] is rule 8's half and belongs to the streaming
//! export, which calls it through `cleaner_core::export::split`.
//!
//! ## The three constants that are not in [`crate::constants`]
//!
//! These are not the table [`crate::constants`] holds. They are kept beside
//! the code that reads them because every one of them is a *geometry* number
//! whose justification is a sentence in rule 2 or rule 3 rather than a
//! measurement on a page.
//!
//! No tile dimension is defined here. Rule 7's preview tile size is fixed by
//! **WebView2 on Windows**, which has never been executed in this repository,
//! and the macOS figure does not transfer. A constant named here would be
//! that figure wearing a general name.
