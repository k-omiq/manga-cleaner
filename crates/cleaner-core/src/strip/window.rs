//! Rule 4: decode windows are per-box, in native units.
//!
//! Rule 4:
//!
//! ```text
//! window = box
//!        ∪ reference_padding(20 px native)
//!        ∪ growth(26 px proxy × k → native)
//!        ∪ inpaint_radius(≤20 px native)
//!        ∪ isolation(5 px native)
//!        ∪ engine_context(512² for LaMa; tier size for cloud)
//!        clamped to the owning page rectangle, joins excepted
//! ```
//!
//! > **Every term is native.** Revision 2 wrote `growth(≤26)` - a *proxy*
//! > number. At k=3 that is 78 native px and at k=4 it is 104, so any window
//! > sized at 26 underran the actual grown mask on exactly the large scans the
//! > proxy exists for.
//!
//! > The segment is a **scheduling** unit; the decode window is a
//! > **correctness** unit. They differ, and that is intended.
//!
//! ## The terms are concentric, and rule 4 listed them as alternatives
//!
//! Read as a set union of six rectangles all anchored on the box, the formula
//! answers `max(20, 26k, 20, 5)`, which is `26k` for every k ≥ 1. That is
//! short of what the pipeline reads and writes, because **three of the terms
//! are measured from the grown mask rather than from the box**:
//!
//! | term | anchored on | reaches |
//! |---|---|---|
//! | `growth` | the seed mask, which is inside the box | `26k` |
//! | the ring [`crate::fit::ring`] samples | the grown mask | `26k + 4` |
//! | `isolation` ([`ISOLATION_RADIUS`]) | the grown mask | `26k + 5` |
//! | rung 1's applied mask ([`EDIT_MARGIN`]) | the grown mask | `26k + 6` |
//! | `inpaint_radius` | the grown mask | `26k + 20` |
//!
//! So the halo this module computes is `max(20, 26k + 20)`, and the union
//! reading is short by 20 px on all four sides at every scale the pipeline ever
//! runs at. A window short of the ring is not a cosmetic defect: the annulus is
//! clipped on the side that ran out, the median moves with whatever the clip
//! removed, and rung 0 fills the region with a tone measured from three sides.
//! The fix was the same shape as an earlier correction - a margin derived
//! from terms whose *composition* was not the one the code performs - one
//! rule further out.
//!
//! ## What is native and what is proxy, in one place
//!
//! [`GROWTH_PROXY`] is the **only** proxy-unit quantity here, and it is
//! multiplied by `k` before it meets anything else. `k` is
//! [`crate::detect::Segmentation::proxy_scale`] - how many native pixels one
//! proxy pixel covers - so `k` is above 1 for every page larger than 1024 on
//! its long edge, which is every page the pipeline is written for.
