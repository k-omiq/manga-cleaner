//! The colour-mode fixtures the fidelity contract is tested against.
//!
//! They are built here rather than committed as files so the test is
//! legible: what makes a fixture interesting - the free palette slot,
//! the 16-bit values that do not survive an 8-bit round-trip, the ICC profile -
//! is visible in the code that constructs it.
//!
//! Every fixture carries the same picture: a horizontal ramp, a vertical ramp,
//! and a dark rectangle standing in for a text block. The ramps are what catch a
//! silent bit-depth reduction; the rectangle is what a synthetic patch is
//! applied over in the mask-subset half of the test.
//!
//! This set was once called "the nine colour-mode fixtures", then listed at
//! eleven. Eleven is right, and there are twelve here: bitonal is added
//! because rung 1 has a "skipped for bitonal sources" rule that nothing
//! else would exercise.
