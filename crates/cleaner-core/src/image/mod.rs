//! Decoding and encoding, with the source's colour mode, bit depth and ICC
//! profile carried through untouched.
//!
//! The fidelity contract this module exists to make enforceable:
//!
//! > Outside the union of all applied masks grown by `edit_margin`, the exported
//! > file's decoded pixels are bit-identical to the source file's decoded
//! > pixels, and the file's colour mode, bit depth and embedded ICC profile are
//! > unchanged from the source.
//!
//! So a [`Raster`] holds samples **exactly as the decoder produced them** -
//! packed sub-byte rows for indexed and bitonal sources, big-endian pairs for
//! 16-bit - and never a normalised internal form. Anything that needs pixels as
//! numbers converts on the way in and writes back through a mask; nothing
//! rewrites the buffer wholesale.
