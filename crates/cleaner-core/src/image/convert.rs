//! Nothing here ever produces something that gets written to a file. A detector
//! wants 8-bit RGB, ring statistics want luma, and both are throwaway views of
//! a raster that keeps its own mode, depth and profile untouched. The
//! conversions are deliberately uncalibrated - an ICC-managed transform would
//! be slower, would need the profile parsed, and would change the numbers a
//! threshold was tuned against for no gain, because every consumer here is
//! comparing a region against its own neighbours rather than against an
//! absolute.
