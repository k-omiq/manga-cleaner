//! What is loaded **right now**, and who may ask for it back.
//!
//! The pressure ladder already gives sessions back when the kernel asks. This
//! module answers the other two questions the ladder never had to: *what is
//! resident at this moment*, and *may the user give one back by hand*. Both
//! are questions from outside the process - the interface's bottom-left tab is
//! the only reader - so what lives here is deliberately thin:
//!
//! - **This registry owns no session.** An `ort::session::Session` is owned by
//!   the type that opens it ([`crate::detect::Detector`],
//!   [`crate::engines::lama::Inpainter`], …) and dropped by that type's own
//!   scope. What is registered is a *row about* one - a kind, a size, a device
//!   and a clock - held under a [`Lease`] whose `Drop` removes the row. A
//!   session cannot be resident without a row, and a row cannot outlive its
//!   session, because the lease is a field of the thing that holds the session.
//! - **An unload is a request, not a kill.** [`request_unload`] sets a flag;
//!   the owner reads it at a point of its own choosing - between regions, where
//!   the last region's buffers are gone and the next one's do not exist - and
//!   drops the session there. Nothing here can interrupt an inference, which is
//!   the whole reason it cannot corrupt one. A run that still needs the model
//!   opens it again on the next region; that is stated in the interface rather
//!   than hidden, because a button that silently degrades the rest of a
//!   chapter is worse than one that frees memory now and pays for it later.
//!
//! ## The size is an estimate, and says which kind
//!
//! [`Basis`] is [`crate::memory::Basis`]'s distinction applied to a different
//! number: a figure someone measured on a running process is not the same
//! thing as the size of the file the session was built from, and rung 2 is the
//! proof - 207 MB of weights, **510 MB resident**. Every row says which it is
//! carrying, so a later measurement can replace a `Weights` row without anyone
//! having to guess whether the old number was one.
