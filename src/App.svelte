   *  1. Route: library / chapters (both Home) and editor.
   *  2. Theme: apply the resolved theme to `<html data-theme>` and follow the
   *     OS live while `system` is selected.
   *  3. Settings: reconcile the session with the backend, once, at boot.
   *  4. Hosts: the notice stack and the modal host.
   *  5. The keyboard layer.
   *  6. The first-launch download offer - the one thing that has to be decided
   *     at launch rather than on a screen.

  // The catalogue is asked once, here, because this is where "the application

  // have to be mounted first, which is the question. `loadCapabilities()`
  // above makes the same call and keeps none of it: it reduces the view to
  // booleans, and the offer needs the sizes, so this is a second `listModels`
  // rather than a shared one. That call is cheap by construction (presence and
  // size, never a digest) and this one happens once per launch.
  //
  // A backend that cannot answer offers nothing: the failure of a catalogue
  // read is the case `state/capabilities` treats as "assume everything is
  // here", and opening a download dialog over a machine whose weights simply
  // could not be listed would be the worse of the two wrong answers.
  //
  // What the offer *is* - the plan, the ticks, the progress, the sequence -

  // run survives the dialog losing the screen. This is the trigger and

  // The stack sits at `z-index: 10` below floating windows (`20 + rank`), so a

     the launch rather than to a screen, where a route change would dismiss it
     (`state/app.svelte.js#setRoute`). Nothing the user can reach pushes a
     dialog while it is up: the backdrop takes every click, and the shortcut
     table is told about a dialog it cannot see (`setDialogOutsideStack`), so
     `,` and `?` no longer answer from underneath. The guard is what is left -
     a net for a push from somewhere else - and it now costs nothing, because
     the run and everything drawn from it are in the store rather than in the
     component: the offer comes back as it was when the stack empties, with the
     transfer it started still running. -->
