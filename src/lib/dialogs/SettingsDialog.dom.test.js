/**
 * The Settings dialog's token row, mounted.
 *
 * `SettingsDialog.test.js` beside this file asserts the one piece of
 * arithmetic the dialog exports and mounts nothing, which is right for a pure
 * function. This is the other half, and it is the half that could not be
 * written until the suite had a jsdom project:
 * what the interface *does* when the credential store refuses to give the
 * token up. The backend end of that refusal is asserted in
 * `weights.rs` and `settings.rs` - `write_token` answers `NotCleared` and
 * `settings::write` returns `Err` rather than reporting a deletion that did
 * not happen - and until here nothing asserted that a user ever heard about
 * it.
 *
 * The seam is stubbed through `setBackend`, which is what that export is for.
 * A hand-written stub rather than the mock: the dialog opens six calls on
 * mount and only one of them is what this file is about, so the rest answer
 * the emptiest true thing - no models, no accelerators, no sidecar - and the
 * catalogue says a token is saved, because that is what makes Clear pressable.
 *
 * The token lives in the **Models** tab, so every test here opens that tab
 * first - through the tab strip, the way a user does. `open()` asserts the
 * panel is shown afterwards rather than trusting the press: the panels are all
 * mounted and merely `hidden`, so a query that found the field without the
 * press would still have found it, and a test that cannot fail is not one.
