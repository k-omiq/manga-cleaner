/**
 * The setup's *state*, and the download run it drives.
 *
 * Why a module and not the component: the downloads must outlive the screen.
 * Finishing the setup while files are still arriving leaves them arriving, a
 * dialog raised over the setup unmounts it (`App.svelte`), and Settings reads
 * the same `model-progress` channel. Everything that must outlive a mount
 * lives here: the plan, the choices, each file's status, the run, and what the
 * cloud setup did. `FirstLaunchDialog.svelte` and its steps only draw it.
 *
 * **It adds no seam method.** The run is `downloadRuntime` and then
 * `downloadModel` per file, one at a time. Pause is `cancelDownload`: the
 * backend keeps the `.part`, and the next request resumes it with a `Range`.
