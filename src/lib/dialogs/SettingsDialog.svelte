   * Settings, as a full-window screen over the route underneath.
   *
   * It is still the `settings` modal kind, so every opener pushes the same
   * spec and the editor stays mounted behind it. `Screen` owns the layer
   * (focus in and back out, the Tab trap, Escape); this file owns the layout:
   * a sidebar with the way back and a vertical tab list, and one scrolling
   * column per section.
   *
   * **Seven sections, in the order a visit needs them.** General holds the
   * preferences and the download token. Detection and Cleaning are the two
   * pipelines a page goes through, each with its engines and the files those
   * engines need, so a file is managed beside the choice that made it
   * necessary; the FLUX helper is Cleaning's. Cloud is `InferenceSettings`,
   * unchanged. Performance is what the engines run on: the runtime, its build,
   * where downloads go, and the accelerator. Shortcuts and About close the
   * list; About is a GPL-3.0 obligation and this screen is its only route.
   *
   * **Every panel is mounted, and only the selected one is shown.** `hidden`
   * rather than `{#if}`, so `aria-controls` names an element that exists, a
   * panel keeps its scroll position while another is looked at, and the
   * mount-time work is one `listModels` and one `about` however many panels
   * are visited.
   *
   * **The tab list is a real one.** `role="tablist"` with
   * `aria-orientation="vertical"`, one tab stop, Up and Down to move, Home and
   * End to the ends. Selection follows focus, which is safe because every
   * panel is already mounted. The outline is h1 (the screen), h2 (the
   * section), h3 below it.
   *
   * **A panel is focusable when, and only when, its tail is not** (WCAG
   * 2.1.1). Performance ends in the placement list and About in prose, so both
   * scrollers take a tab stop. Detection does too while it has no file rows,
   * when it ends in the engine table.
   *
   * **The backend reconciliation is not here.** `session.*` and
   * `backend.readSettings()` are reconciled once at boot, in `App.svelte`.
   * What this screen owns is the second half: every change pushes the
   * session's values down to the backend immediately.
   *
   * **The shortcut section is not a read-only list.** `ShortcutSheet` is where
   * a binding is *changed*, and it writes its own half of the settings, so it
   * behaves identically here and mounted on its own by `?`.
