  /**
   * Export - format, layout, destination, masks, and the things the user needs
   * to know before the button is pressed.
   *
   * **The note is not decoration.** "Masks drawn by hand and masks made
   * automatically export identically" is the answer to the
   * question the Masks row raises, and the flagged count is the answer to a
   * question nothing else on screen asks: exporting with regions still flagged
   * is legal, and a user is owed the figure before they do it rather than
   * after.
   *
   * **The gutter statement is an obligation.**
   * A strip whose pages are not all the same width has columns beside the
   * narrow ones that no source file has a pixel for, and "an interface offering
   * stitched output states the count before it runs, exactly as
   * it requires of every other change
   * the user did not ask for". `gutterPixels` below is that count, computed
   * from the page dimensions this screen already holds; the backend reports
   * what it actually wrote back on `gutterPixels`, and the two are the same
   * arithmetic from the two ends.
   *
   * **What the format row does not offer.** JPEG is gone from it. It is lossy,
   * the export contract puts lossy output below the fidelity line and the build
   * plan puts it behind an acknowledgement flow that does not exist - so the
   * backend refuses it, and a button whose only outcome is a refusal is worse
   * than no button. TIFF took its place: it is the one format here that carries
   * CMYK, and the contract names it for stitched longstrip. PSD is the contract's
   * layered file, per page only.
   *
   * **The Masks row means two things, and says which.** For PNG and TIFF,
   * "Separate layer" is a mask file beside each page - `001.png` and
   * `001_mask.png`. For PSD it is the layered document: the untouched page as
   * the Background, one masked layer per region. The row's description
   * follows the format. For CBZ the row is not shown at all, because a mask
   * file inside a reader's archive would be read as a page and the backend
   * refuses the pair; the seam is sent `'flattened'` for it.
   *
   * **The overwrite refusal, and the ten that are not it.**
   * `backend.exportChapter` answers `status: 'refused'` for eleven different
   * reasons now, and only one of them has a way out this dialog can offer.
   * `notice.export.refusedOverwrite` (output never
   * overwrites input) is pushed *on top of* this dialog with `dismissable:
   * false` - no Escape, no backdrop - and exactly one action, "Choose another
   * folder…", because the doc's way out of a refusal is a named choice and not
   * a dismissal. Every other refusal is answered by changing what was asked
   * for, so the adapter's notice says why and this dialog simply stays open
   * with the choices still in it. Branching on `status` alone would push the
   * overwrite modal over a user who asked for JPEG.
   *
   * **The draft lives in `spec.props`, not in this component.** Pushing the
   * refusal unmounts this dialog - the host mounts only the top of the stack -
   * and `{#key spec.id}` makes the return a fresh mount. Component state would
   * be gone by then, and the user would find the format they chose reset along
   * with the destination. The spec survives on the stack, so the draft does.
