/**
 * The dialog registry: modal `kind` → the component that draws it.
 *
 * `src/lib/shell/ModalHost.svelte` asks `dialogFor(spec.kind)` and mounts what
 * it gets; a kind with no entry falls through to the host's generic dialog -
 * a title, a line of copy (`props.bodyKey`) and the spec's action buttons -
 * which is all a confirmation or a refusal needs. So there is no `{#if}` chain
 * to grow: a new dialog is a file and a line in this table.
 *
 * Home's four were registered in `src/lib/home/dialogs/index.js` before this
 * module existed and stay there, next to the screen whose state they mutate.
 * They are folded in here so the host has **one** registry to consult rather
 * than two to merge.
 *
 * Kinds that deliberately have no component, and why:
 *
 * - `overwriteRefusal` - a statement and one named action. The generic dialog
 *   renders it exactly, and `dismissable: false` is what makes it a refusal
 *   rather than a warning.
 * - `removeProject` - the same shape, from `src/lib/home/actions.js`.
