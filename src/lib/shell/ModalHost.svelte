  /**
   * The modal host. Mounts **exactly one** dialog - the top of
   * `app.modals` - because Task 4's `Modal` listens for Escape on `window`
   * and captures focus on mount; two mounted dialogs would both answer one
   * keypress and fight over the focus ring.
   *
   * The stack is what lets one dialog raise another and be found again
   * underneath it. The Export dialog does exactly that: an export aimed at the
   * source folder is refused, the refusal goes on top, and answering it reveals
   * the export dialog again with its destination put right.
   *
   * The cloud flow is **two pushes, not a replace**. `closeModal` pops the
   * stack *before* the resolved promise continues, so by the time the
   * transmission statement's answer reaches the flow there is nothing of its
   * own left on top to replace - a `replaceModal` there would overwrite
   * whatever was underneath instead. The cost confirmation is therefore a
   * second `pushModal`, raised when the adapter comes back asking for it. See
   * `src/lib/editor/cloudflow.svelte.js`.
   *
   * A `kind` may claim a dialog of its own by registering a component in
   * `src/lib/dialogs/index.js`. Such a component receives the `spec` and
   * renders its own `Modal`, so it owns its width, its footnote and its
   * buttons.
   *
   * Everything else falls through to the generic dialog below: a title, an
   * optional line of copy (`props.bodyKey`, `props.bodyParams`) and the spec's
   * action buttons. That is the whole of a confirmation (`removeProject`) and
   * the whole of a refusal (`overwriteRefusal`, whose `dismissable: false`
   * leaves the named action as the only way out). The contract: read the spec
   * from the top of the stack, render `spec.actions` as the buttons, and
   * resolve by calling `closeModal(actionId)` - which pops the stack and fires
   * the spec's `onresolve`.
