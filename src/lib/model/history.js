/**
 * Global undo/redo: one stack across every tool, **persisted
 * to the project folder**. Plain data plus free
 * functions rather than a class, so a `History` can live directly inside a
 * component's `$state` - mutating the arrays in place is what makes that
 * reactive without extra plumbing.
 *
 * ## What changed, and why the shape did
 *
 * A history used to be two stacks of `{label, undo(), redo()}` closures. Two
 * things were wrong with that, and only one of them was the forgetting:
 *
 *  - **A closure keeps its page alive.** Each command closed over two whole
 *    region snapshots, so a session's history pinned every page the user had
 *    edited - which is exactly what the chapter-wide residency's three-page
 *    window exists to remove. Evicting page 140 gave back nothing while a
 *    closure over page 140 was still on the stack.
 *  - **A closure cannot be written down**, so nothing survived a restart.
 *
 * So a history is now an **index**: a cursor over `{seq, label}` pairs, and
 * nothing else. That is enough to answer `canUndo`, `canRedo` and both
 * tooltips, which is everything the interface reads. The payload - the delta
 * that says what to reverse - lives on disk and is fetched one entry at a time,
 * at the moment it is replayed. RAM is flat in edit count.
 *
 * ## The stacks still move synchronously
 *
 * `canUndo` and the undo label must never lag behind the click that changed
 * them, so the cursor moves at call time and the backend round trip is queued
 * behind whatever is already in flight. `running` is the tail of that chain:
 * each replay is queued behind the one before it, and a rejection is caught
 * there - the cursor has already moved, and an unhandled rejection on top of
 * that helps nobody. The failure is kept on `error` for a caller that wants to
 * say so.
 *
 * Two fast undos would otherwise put two adapter calls in flight with no
 * ordering guarantee, and whichever settled last would win.
