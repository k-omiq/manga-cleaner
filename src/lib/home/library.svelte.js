 * Home needs the project list, and putting it in `app.svelte.js` would have
 * made every consumer of the route depend on a load. It is a module rather
 * than component state because Home's dialogs are mounted by the global modal
 * host (`src/lib/shell/ModalHost.svelte`), outside `HomeScreen`'s tree: the
 * New chapter dialog has to see the same projects the grid does.
 *
 * Every mutation re-reads the list from the backend instead of patching the
 * local copy. `listProjects()` returns structured clones, so a local patch is
 * a second implementation of what the backend already did, and the two can
 * disagree. A re-read cannot.
