/**
 * The catalogue and the source must agree in **both** directions:
 *
 * 1. every key the app renders has an entry - otherwise a screen shows `[key]`;
 * 2. every entry is rendered by something - otherwise the catalogue accumulates
 *    dead strings that a translator pays to translate and nobody ever reads.
 *
 * Direction 2 is the one that needs a source scan, and the scan can only see
 * *literal* keys. A key assembled at runtime has no literal to find, so it is
 * listed below - and **listed key by key, never as a wildcard prefix**. A
 * wildcard is exactly the hole a dead key survives through: allow
 * `progress.status.*` and `progress.status.abandoned` lives forever.
 *
 * Two of the families are computed from the code that owns the enumeration
 * rather than typed out, so they cannot drift from it at all.
 *
 * ## Both languages
 *
 * A use is a literal occurrence in any shipped `.js`, `.svelte` **or `.rs`**
 * file. The Rust core chooses a key for every outcome it reports, and until it
 * was scanned a key it named and the catalogue lacked rendered `[key]` at
 * runtime with this test green - the hole closed by widening the scan
 * rather than by maintaining a second list by hand.
 *
 * ## What green still does *not* mean
 *
 * The mock adapter is a shipped file, so an entry named only by
 * `src/lib/api/fixtures.js` or `src/lib/api/mock.js` counts as used even
 * though the only thing rendering it is fixture data. Today that is
 * `about.fact.*`, `time.relative.*` and three `notice.input.*` - the mock is
 * still the fallback backend, so they are alive; **delete the mock and every
 * one of them goes dead with this test green.** (`decline.reason.qualityMetric`
 * and `input.skipReason.*` left that list when the Rust scan began: the core
 * names them.)
 *
 * That is a real limit of scanning rather than a bug to engineer away - a
 * scanner cannot tell a fixture that names a key from a component that
 * renders one, and a rule excluding `src/lib/api` would be wrong the moment
 * the adapter legitimately reports a key. It is written down here so that
 * whoever finally removes the mock knows to re-check these three families by
 * hand at that point, which is the one moment it matters.
