/**
 * Finding every i18n key the source uses.
 *
 * This exists for one consumer, `catalogue.test.js`, which asserts the
 * catalogue and the source agree in **both** directions: no key used without an
 * entry, no entry without a use. That second direction is the one that needs a
 * scanner rather than a runtime check - a dead string is invisible at runtime.
 *
 * Pure, string-in / set-out, so it is testable without a filesystem.
 *
 * **The source is two languages.** The Rust core chooses a key for every
 * outcome it reports - every `reasonKey`, `skipReason`, rung and execution
 * provider - and it writes them as string literals exactly as the JavaScript
 * does. Line and block comments are the same syntax in both, and `///` and
 * `//!` fall under the line rule, so the same scanner reads both without a
 * special case. This is what closes the hole
 * from the other side: a Rust string *is* a literal occurrence now.
 *
 * Two deliberate limits, both of which the test compensates for by *listing*
 * what they miss rather than waving it through:
 *
 * 1. Comments are stripped first. A key named in a doc comment is documentation,
 *    not a use, and letting one count would keep a dead key alive forever.
 * 2. Only *literal* keys are found. A key assembled at runtime
 *    (`progress.status.${status}`) has no literal to find, so the test
 *    enumerates those families key by key. See `DYNAMIC_KEYS` there.
