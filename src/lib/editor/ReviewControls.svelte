  /**
   * `« »` - previous / next region needing review, with an `n / total`
   * readout, in the bottom-right pill beside the page controls.
   *
   * The set is the chapter's, computed by `model/review.js`; stepping it moves
   * the page as well as the selection, which is why it goes through
   * `stepReview` rather than through the selection directly. Before the user
   * has entered the set there is no current region, and the readout says so
   * with a dash rather than with a `0` that would read as a position.
   *
   * The double chevrons point the way the *set* runs, not the way the pages
   * do: the review set is in page order whichever direction the chapter reads,
   * so these two are the one pair in the chrome that reading direction does
   * not flip.
