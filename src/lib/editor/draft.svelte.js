/**
 * The gesture in progress: what the pointer (or the arrow keys) have described
 * so far, before anything has been committed through the seam.
 *
 * **State only.** This module imports nothing - not the editor's state, not the
 * backend, not Svelte's DOM. That is what lets `state/editor.svelte.js` clear a
 * draft from `cancelInteraction()` and `resetSessionState()` without a cycle,
 * and it keeps "what has been drawn" separate from "what has been applied": a
 * draft is not an edit, and abandoning one must leave the chapter untouched.
 *
 * The clone source lives here too. It is not part of any one gesture - it is
 * sampled once and read by every stroke afterwards - but it
 * is the same kind of thing: a decision the user has made with a tool that no
 * backend knows about yet.
