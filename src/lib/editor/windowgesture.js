/**
 * Moving and sizing a floating thing, by pointer and by keyboard.
 *
 * `FloatingWindow.svelte` owned all of this until the tool bar wanted the
 * moving half of it: a bar that is dragged by a grip, put back by `Escape` and
 * nudged by the arrow keys is the window's gesture exactly, and a second copy
 * of it in a second component is two places for one behaviour to drift in.
 * So the handlers live here and both components attach them.
 *
 * Nothing in this module is reactive. The gesture is one mutable record that
 * exists between a `pointerdown` and its `pointerup`, and no view depends on
 * it - what the view reads is `session.windows[id]`, which these handlers
 * write through `setWindowBox` like any other move.
 *
 * The height is a callback rather than a number because a window with no
 * explicit height is sized by its content, and the first drag on its corner
 * has to start from whatever the browser made of it.
