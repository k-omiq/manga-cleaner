/**
 * How a planned dab becomes pixels on a `<canvas>` - and nothing else.
 *
 * **Pure, and deliberately DOM-free.** Everything here takes a 2D context as an
 * argument and never reaches for one, never touches `document`, and never
 * schedules a frame. That is what lets the whole of the live preview's drawing
 * be tested in the frontend's `node` test environment against a recording fake
 * context, in a repo whose vitest has no canvas at all - the component in
 * `PaintLayer.svelte` is then only lifecycle and sizing.
 *
 * ## The three coordinate spaces, and the one number that joins them
 *
 * A dab is planned once, in **native page pixels**
 * (`paintplan.js`), because that is the space the commit stamps in and parity
 * of the plan is the whole bargain. The canvas is a *proxy*:
 * whatever CSS box the sheet happens to occupy, times `devicePixelRatio`. So
 * every routine here takes a single `scale` = canvasWidth / pageWidth and
 * multiplies. Nothing else converts anything.
 *
 * ## Flow, opacity, and why there are two canvases
 *
 * `flow` is *per dab* and `opacity` is a ceiling on the *stroke*: overlapping
 * dabs at 20% flow build towards the opacity, and they must never build past
 * it. One canvas cannot express that - each dab would composite over the last
 * and a slow stroke would go solid. So the caller stamps into an offscreen
 * stroke canvas at per-dab alpha and then presents that canvas once, at
 * `globalAlpha = opacity/100`. [`presentStroke`] is that second step.
 *
 * This approximates rather than reproduces `cleaner-core`'s compositor, which
 * accumulates coverage in f32 and blends once. The falloff curve is matched
 * exactly ([`dabStops`] mirrors `paint/brush.rs#analytic_radial_coverage`); the
 * accumulation is not, because Canvas2D has no premultiplied coverage buffer to
 * borrow. §4 permits this: the preview owes the user the *plan*, not the bytes.
 */

/**
 * The smallest dab the preview will draw, in **canvas** pixels.
 *
 * 00-design.md risk 4: a native-space radius that is honest can still be a
 * quarter of a proxy pixel at a zoomed-out longstrip, and a stroke of
 * quarter-pixel discs is an invisible stroke - the user would see nothing at
 * all until the commit came back. A floor makes a thin stroke *too thick* in
 * the preview instead of absent, which is the failure that can be reasoned
 * about.
