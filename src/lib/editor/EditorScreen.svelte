  /**
   * The editor: a full-viewport canvas with everything else floating over it.
   *
   * The canvas viewport is the only scroll container in the screen. The two
   * clusters, the tool rail and the two bottom pills are fixed at `z-index:40`;
   * the two windows and the tool bar sit at `20 + rank`, so a raised one
   * comes forward of the others but can never cover a fixed control.
   *
   * **DOM order is the tab order**, and it is deliberately not the visual
   * order: clusters, windows and the tool bar, rail, pills, and the canvas
   * last. A keyboard user meets what is fixed before what floats, and the
   * scroller - which has no controls of its own - last.
   *
   * They render in a fixed order and stack by `z-index` alone. Sorting
   * the markup by stacking rank would move a window's DOM node the moment it
   * was clicked or focused, which drops focus and can swallow the click that
   * caused it; a stable tab order is worth more than a tab order that tracks
   * the stack.
   *
   * This screen owns the chapter's lifecycle: `openEditorChapter` on mount and
   * on every route change, `closeEditorChapter` on teardown. The backend
   * subscription and the autosave flush both hang off that pair.
