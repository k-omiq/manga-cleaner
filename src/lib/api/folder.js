/**
 * The folder chooser.
 *
 * A project and a chapter each need to be told where their scans are, and until
 * this existed the only way to say so was to type an absolute path from memory
 * into a text field. That is not an interface anybody can use for a folder
 * eleven levels down a drive, and it is the half of import that was missing:
 * `createProject` and `createChapter` were real commands with no way to reach
 * the one argument that matters.
 *
 * It is deliberately **not** on the seam. The seam
 * is the contract between the interface and a backend that owns a library, and
 * a native file chooser is neither: it produces no library state, it belongs to
 * the window rather than to the data, and a backend that ran headlessly would
 * have nothing to answer with. So it lives beside the adapters instead, and the
 * two dialogs that need it import it directly.
 *
 * Outside a Tauri window - the browser dev server, and vitest - there is no
 * chooser, and this returns `null` rather than throwing. `null` is also what a
 * user who dismissed the chooser produces, and the two are handled the same way
 * on purpose: in both cases nothing was chosen, and the field the caller is
 * filling keeps whatever was already typed in it. The typed field is not a
 * fallback that will be removed once the chooser works; it stays, because a
 * path pasted from a terminal is faster than eleven clicks and because it is
 * the only way this screen works at all when there is no chooser to open.

 * the module stops loading in a plain browser and in vitest, where the import
 * throws before any of this is reached. The command name and its argument shape
 * are the plugin's own (`plugin:dialog|open`, `{ options }`), and the window is
