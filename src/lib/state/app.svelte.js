/**
 * Application-level shell state: where we are, what is blocking, what is being
 * announced. Nothing project-specific lives here - the editor owns that.
 *
 * Route model
 * -----------
 * Home is a two-level hierarchy, Projects → Chapters (constraints.md ruling 1),
 * so the brief's `home | editor` is expressed as three route names:
 *
 *   library   the project grid, the root
 *   chapters  one project's chapter list
 *   editor    one chapter open in the editor
 *
 * `back()` walks that hierarchy: the editor returns to *its project's* chapter
 * list, not to the library root. (The `H` shortcut is the separate "go all the
 * way home" affordance.)
 *
 * Modal stack
 * -----------
 * A stack, not a slot, because a dialog can raise another and has to be found
 * again underneath it: the Export dialog raises the overwrite refusal, and
 * answering the refusal reveals Export with its destination put right. Task 4's
 * `Modal` handles Escape on `window` and is mount-driven, so **only the top of
 * the stack is ever mounted** - see `src/lib/shell/ModalHost.svelte`.
