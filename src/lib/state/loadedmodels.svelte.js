/**
 * What the backend has in memory right now, polled.
 *
 * **A poll and not the event channel**, deliberately. The seam's event stream is a
 * *run's* narration - page started, region done, run finished - and it is
 * ordered per run. What is loaded is not a fact about a run: a region edit
 * loads a model without starting one, a session is given back between two
 * regions, and rung 3a's child comes and goes inside a single click. Putting
 * that on the run stream would either invent events for things that are not
 * runs or leave the tab stale for the cases that are not.
 *
 * The cost is bounded on purpose: the command behind this walks a handful of
 * rows under one mutex and touches no session (`src-tauri/src/models.rs`), and
 * the poll only runs while the editor is on screen.
 *
 * **The list is one interval behind the truth, in both directions**, and the
 * interface is written for that rather than against it. A model can finish and
 * vanish between two polls, and a model asked to unload keeps its row until the
 * run reaches a region boundary - which is why `unloading` is a field the row
 * carries rather than something this module fakes by removing the row early.
 * Removing it early would claim memory back that is still held.
