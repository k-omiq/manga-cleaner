/**
 * The resident page window.
 *
 * ## What was already lazy, and what was not
 *
 * Pixels have never been the problem. A page's bytes reach the webview over the
 * `tile://` protocol as proxy tiles, tiles inside a page are
 * `loading="lazy"`, and `src/lib/editor/strip.js` mounts only the visible band
 * of a longstrip column plus one page of overscan. Nothing in this module
 * touches any of that, and nothing in it needs to.
 *
 * What sat in RAM for a whole chapter was **region state**: `ApiRegion` objects,
 * one per detected bubble, each carrying a mask reference and a provenance
 * record, all of them arriving in one payload when a chapter opened and none of
 * them ever leaving. A 200-page chapter at twenty regions a page is four
 * thousand of those, they are `$state`-proxied the moment they land in
 * `editor.chapter`, and every one of them is live for the session. On a
 * low-memory machine that is the difference this module is about.
 *
 * ## The window
 *
 * **Previous, current, next.** Three pages' regions are resident; everything
 * else is a header - a name, a size, a status and a region *count*. Moving to a
 * page loads it and its neighbours and drops what has left, so the cost is flat
 * in chapter length rather than linear in it.
 *
 * In a longstrip chapter the window is that band **union the strip's own
 * scope** - the positions the column actually has on screen, which the canvas
 * reports through `setStripScope`. Those are the pages the Layers panel is
 * listing (`scopePageIndices`), so a window that did not contain them would
 * make the panel empty at exactly the moment it is being read. The strip's own
 * virtualisation already bounds that band, so this cannot grow without bound;
 * it is "three pages, or what is on screen, whichever is the larger claim".
 *
 * ## Nothing here has to be flushed
 *
 * A page is evicted by dropping its regions, and that is safe because **the
 * interface never holds an unsaved region**. Every edit goes through the seam
 * and is written to the manifest before the interface applies its own copy -
 * `maskactions.svelte.js` says so at the top and every call site obeys it - so
 * a resident region is a *cache of a file*, never the only copy. The one thing
 * that used to be session-only, the undo history, is now a journal on disk too
 * which is what makes the eviction actually give memory back:
 * before that, a closure on the undo stack kept the region alive anyway.
 *
 * ## Concurrency
 *
 * A window slide is async and page turns are not. Two slides in flight would
 * race, and the loser would write its regions into a chapter that has moved on.
 * So each slide takes a token, and a slide whose token has been superseded
 * applies nothing.
