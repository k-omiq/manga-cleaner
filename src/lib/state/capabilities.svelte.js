/**
 * What this machine can do that another one cannot.
 *
 * Two questions with the same shape and the same rule. Rung 3a, the FLUX
 * sidecar, ships with nothing and is installed by
 * hand. The weights are not bundled either - they
 * are downloaded after install, from Settings › Models - so on a fresh machine
 * *every* engine below rung 3a is missing too, and until this store carried
 * them the interface offered all five rungs and a run failed on the first page
 * for want of a file the user had no way to fetch.
 *
 * **Absence is the normal state and it is silent.** The backend answers
 * `reasonKey: null` for a machine that never installed anything, which is what
 * §4a asks for: a user "is told why rather than shown a control that fails",
 * and the answer to *why* for a machine that installed nothing is that there is
 * nothing to tell. A reason arrives only when something *is* installed and this
 * machine still will not carry it, and then it is in the same
 * `decline.reason.*` vocabulary a review row uses. The weights get the same
 * treatment for a different reason: the remedy for a missing weight is one
 * press in Settings, so the tool that needs it names Settings rather than
 * showing a control that would fail.
 *
 * **The engine map is derived from the catalogue's own `requiredBy`, not from
 * a list written here.** `src-tauri/src/weights.rs` says which engines each
 * file is a precondition of; this walks the rows and intersects them. An engine
 * no row names - `fill` and `denoise`, which need no weights at all - is
 * available by falling out of the rule rather than by being written down a
 * second time, and a seventh weight added to the catalogue tomorrow gates
 * whatever it says it gates with no change here.
