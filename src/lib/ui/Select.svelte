  /**
   * A one-of-many picker for lists too long to be chips.
   *
   * `Segmented` is the app's radio group and stays the right control while a
   * row holds two or three options: every option is visible, and the whole row
   * is one press away. Past three it stops being that - the chips wrap onto a
   * second and third line, the row grows taller than the slider above it, and
   * the engine ladder is five names long and will not get shorter. This is
   * that row instead: one line, one width, whatever the list holds.
   *
   * It is a **native `<select>`** under a painted chevron, which is the same
   * control a Layers row's engine picker already is. The popup a native select
   * opens is drawn by the platform rather than by the page, so it is the one
   * kind of menu that can be opened from inside a floating window without
   * being clipped by the window's own `overflow: hidden` - and it arrives with
   * type-ahead, `Home`/`End`, and the platform's own touch and screen-reader
   * behaviour already in it.
   *
   * Controlled, like `Segmented` and `Slider`: the caller owns `value` and
   * gets every change through `onchange`.
   *
   * Options are `{ value, label?, disabled?, title? }`.
   *
   * **Two sizes, one control.** `md` is the tool window's - 26 high, the
   * metrics of an `md` chip, so a row that is a select and a row that is a
   * group of chips are the same height. `row` is the Layers panel's, 22 high
   * and a half-point smaller, which is the scale that list is drawn at. They
   * exist because a Layers row used to draw a `<select>` of its own with its
   * own border and its own font size: the same
   * control asking the same question in two appearances.
   *
   * **`fit`** takes the control down to the width of its own longest option
   * rather than its container's. It is the tool window's, where a choice row
   * stacks its control under its label and "everything to the right" is the
   * whole panel: a 280px bar reading *Rect* was the largest single piece of
   * empty space left in it. A native `<select>` measures its widest option
   * for us, so the control is exactly as wide as the longest thing it will
   * ever have to show - in whatever language it is showing it - and the chips
   * beside it in the same panel are their own width for the same reason.
   *
   * @type {{
   *   options: Array<{ value: string, label?: string, disabled?: boolean, title?: string }>,
   *   value: string,
   *   onchange: (value: string) => void,
   *   size?: 'md' | 'row',
   *   fit?: boolean,
   *   label?: string,
   *   labelledBy?: string,
   *   id?: string,
   *   title?: string,
   *   disabled?: boolean,
   * }}
