/**
 * The open state of an anchored overlay, and the ways one is dismissed.
 *
 * `Menu` and `Popover` differ in what they hold - a list of items with roving
 * focus, a panel of ordinary controls - and agree on most of how they come and
 * go: the element that was focused is remembered on the way up, an outside
 * pointerdown closes without taking focus back (the press has already given it
 * somewhere else), and `Escape` closes and returns it. That agreement was two
 * copies of the same twenty lines until this module.
 *
 * Where they part is `Tab`. A menu is **one control** - Tab leaves it, so Tab
 * dismisses it (`tabAway`). A popover is a *panel of several*, and Tab inside
 * one moves between them; the first Tab out of the first slider used to take
 * the whole Adjustments panel with it. What ends a popover is focus actually
 * leaving the anchor for somewhere else (`focusOut`), which is the event a Tab
 * off the last control produces; a pointer press elsewhere is the outside
 * listener's, as it is for a menu.
 *
 * The outside listener is registered in a `$effect`, so this must be called
 * during a component's initialisation - which is the only place either
 * component calls it.
