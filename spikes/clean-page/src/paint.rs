//! Pictures for a human, and nothing on the export path.
//!
//! Everything here works in 8-bit RGB, which is the one thing the exported page
//! is never allowed to become: the color fidelity and export contract keeps
//! the source's mode, depth and profile end to end. These are viewing
//! copies, and they are a separate module from anything the export path touches
//! so that the separation is visible in the file list rather than only in a
//! comment.
//!
//! The label font is here for the same reason the contact sheet exists at all.
//! There are findings about
//! *particular regions* - r4, r9, r11, r12 of `page-crowded` - and a grid of
//! unlabelled crops cannot be checked against them. A 5×7 bitmap font is the
//! whole of the dependency needed to write "R09 LAMA 631MS INK 118" under a
//! crop, and a spike that pulled a font stack in to do it would be paying a
//! great deal for kerning nobody will read.
