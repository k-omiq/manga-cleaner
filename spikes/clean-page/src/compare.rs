//! Every engine that produces pixels, on the same regions, **one session at a
//! time**.
//!
//! ```text
//! spike-clean-page <page.png> --compare-engines [--out-dir DIR]
//! ```
//!
//! Three rungs produce pixels today - rung 0 [`fill`], rung 1 [`denoise`], rung 2
//! [`lama`]; MI-GAN's rung 3 is gone from the ladder - and there is no image anywhere in this
//! repository that shows what they do to the same region. This makes one: a
//! contact sheet whose rows are regions and whose columns are the page, then
//! each rung in order, every crop labelled with the rung, its latency and its
//! residue count.
//!
//! ## Why this is three phases with hard drops between them
//!
//! The obvious shape - open everything, loop over regions, write images - is the
//! shape the earlier `compare_rungs` had, and it was wrong for three separate
//! reasons rather than for tidiness.
//!
//! **It can abort the process.** Two WebGPU sessions live at once produce
//! *"A command encoder is already
//! encoding to this command buffer"*, or `-[_MTLCommandEncoder dealloc]` failing
//! its `Command encoder released without endEncoding` assertion, and SIGABRT.
//! [`Preference::Automatic`] selects WebGPU for both model rungs on an M5, so
//! holding two model sessions together (as rung 2 and the removed rung 3 once
//! were) is one timing accident away from losing the run.
//!
//! **It cannot report memory honestly.** The detector alone is ~195 MB of
//! session and ~1.2 GB of ONNX Runtime arena, a held LaMa session is
//! ~350 MB, MI-GAN's is ~20 MB with its own arena beside it. A
//! harness that stacks five allocators and then prints an RSS number is printing
//! the sum of its own mistakes.
//!
//! **It is not what rule 6 asks
//! of the application.** One thing in flight, buffers dropped before the next
//! begins, is the discipline the whole memory budget rests on, and a comparison
//! that violates it measures something the shipping code never does.
//!
//! So: **Phase A** opens the three detection sessions, produces one
//! [`fit::Fitted`] per gated region, and drops all three before any engine
//! opens. **Phase B** runs the four rungs in order, each model rung opening its
//! session, rendering every region, and dropping it before the next rung is
//! reached. **Phase C** composes and writes the images, with no session alive at
//! all.
//!
//! ## Why two engines cannot be held here by accident
//!
//! Not by discipline - by the return types. [`with_lama`] (and the removed
//! `with_migan` before it) opens its session as a **local** and returns `Vec<Option<Shot>>`,
//! which contains rasters and no session. There is no binding in [`run`] that
//! could hold an [`lama::Inpainter`], so no later edit can accidentally extend
//! one's life across the other's open; the compiler rejects the attempt rather
//! than a reviewer catching it. The explicit `drop` before each function's final
//! RSS sample is not what provides the guarantee - it is what makes the sample
//! land *after* the release rather than at the closing brace.
//!
//! ## What this may not conclude
//!
//! **No winner is declared between rungs 2 and 3.** A quality
//! comparison wants a licence-cleared corpus and synthetic fixtures
//! are forbidden from standing in for one. Residue counts and visible defects are
//! observations, and they are reported as such; a ranking would be a claim this
//! corpus cannot carry - every rung-2 region in this
//! repository is a flat-paper dialogue balloon that arrived through a
//! fallback with a fixture defect underneath it.
//!
//! ## The residue number
//!
//! **Pixels more than 64 levels below the region's own paper**, counted over
//! `mask ⊕ ISOLATION_RADIUS` - the set both model rungs are permitted to write
//! through ([`engines::model::applied_mask`]), so the same set is counted for
//! all five columns including the untouched page.
//!
//! It is not summed darkness: "16-30% retained ink" was
//! measured that way and the quantity is dominated by rung 2's fill sitting
//! about one level under the surrounding paper. r9 read 36.4% of its box
//! by that measure with 149 pixels actually dark and the balloon visually clean.
//! A threshold well below the paper counts marks; a sum counts the offset.
