//! Peak RSS over a long chapter, through the rules that decide it.
//!
//! ```text
//! /usr/bin/time -l cargo run --release -p spike-strip-memory -- --pages 200
//! ```
//!
//! ## What this measures, and what it does not
//!
//! Phase 2's exit criterion is "a 200-page
//! **webtoon chapter** cleans end to end with peak RSS under 400 MB (rungs 0/1
//! only)". This harness feeds it a **synthetic** strip, and the number it
//! produces is therefore not that criterion.
//!
//! `fixtures/pages/` standing in for a licence-cleared corpus is forbidden,
//! and that rule is about **content**
//! judgements - flag rate, Latin regions, inpainter quality - which are
//! properties of what is drawn. Peak RSS is a property of buffer sizes and of
//! the order things are allocated in, so a synthetic strip is a defensible
//! input for *this* measurement and for nothing else in the phase. What a
//! synthetic page does change is how much **work** there is: fewer detected
//! boxes means fewer patches held, so the number below is a floor on the real
//! one rather than an estimate of it.
//!
//! Two things the criterion names that are outside this process entirely:
//!
//! - **the webview**, 120-180 MB of the own budget. This is a command-line
//!   binary and there is no WKWebView in it.
//! - **the Tauri command layer and the event channel**, which the run adds
//!   around the same pipeline.
//!
//! So this is the Rust core's half of the budget - the row marked "Rust core,
//! idle ~40 MB", the detector, the balloon detector, the script gate, and the
//! decode window and working buffers - and the honest way to read the result is
//! against those rows and not against the 400 MB.
//!
//! The peak itself is **not** measured from inside this process. `getrusage`
//! is not reachable without a libc dependency this workspace does not carry, and
//! sampling `ps` gives a sampled maximum rather than a peak. `/usr/bin/time -l`
//! reports `maximum resident set size` from the kernel, which is the real one.
//! What this binary prints is the *current* RSS at each phase boundary, read
//! from `ps`, which is enough to say where the peak came from.
//!
//! ## Phase 3's memory criterion, per rung
//!
//! Phase 3 asks for something this harness
//! could not previously answer:
//!
//! > peak RSS over a multi-region page, **per rung** … Criterion: **flat across
//! > regions**. A rung whose peak grows with region count fails, and that is a
//! > separate failure from being large: LaMa at 250 MB flat passes and a 5 GB
//! > engine that ratchets does not.
//!
//! Three things were missing and all three are flags now.
//!
//! **A page with enough regions for a ratchet to show.** `--page <file>` reads
//! a real fixture instead of drawing a synthetic strip, and repeats it
//! `--pages` times. `fixtures/pages/page-crowded.png` is the one this exists
//! for: twenty detected regions against one to four on every other fixture, so
//! four copies of it is eighty regions through one held session.
//!
//! **The ladder, open.** `--rung 2` and `--rung 3` run the model rungs, which
//! the earlier rungs-0/1 harness never did.
//!
//! **Attribution.** `--rung` does not *route*; it says which single rung every
//! region that needs a model is run on. That is what "per rung" requires and it
//! is deliberately not what [`src-tauri`'s run](../../src-tauri/src/run.rs)
//! does - the run tries rung 2 and escalates to rung 3 only on a decline, which
//! attributes a peak to whichever rungs happened to be involved. A measurement
//! of one rung has to run one rung.
//!
//! The RSS is sampled **after every region**, which makes the number a series
//! rather than a maximum: a rung that ratchets shows growth against region
//! index, and a rung that is merely large shows a step at the first region and
//! a flat line after it. The verdict printed at the end is that comparison and
//! the numbers it was made from are printed beside it, so a reader who
//! disagrees with the bound can apply their own.
