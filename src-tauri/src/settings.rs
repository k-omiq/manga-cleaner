//! `readSettings` and `writeSettings`.
//!
//! A patch is **merged**
//! and the whole snapshot comes back. Two consequences the implementation turns
//! on:
//!
//! - The merge is shallow, one level, matching what the interface sends: it
//!   writes `{cloud: {allowed: true}}`-shaped patches only at the top level, and
//!   a deep merge would make "unset this key" unexpressible.
//! - The vocabulary belongs to the interface, not here. This module stores and
//!   returns JSON without knowing what a setting means, for the same reason
//!   the manifest's `settings` snapshot does: a second definition of the
//!   settings shape is a second thing to disagree with the first.
//!
//! The defaults therefore come from the interface too - the adapter sends them
//! once at startup, and until it does, an unwritten settings file reads as `{}`
//! and the interface's own defaults apply.
//!
//! ## One key does not live here
//!
//! `hfToken` arrives through the same patch as every other setting and is the
//! one that never lands in the file. [`write`] lifts it out and hands it to
//! [`crate::weights::store_token`], which puts it in the operating system's
//! credential store; the merged snapshot that comes back has no such key. Only
//! when there is no usable store - a headless Linux box, a keychain that will
//! not answer - does it stay here, which is still better than a token
//! the user has to paste again every launch.
//!
//! The interception is in `write` rather than in the command wrapper so that
//! there is one place a secret can leak into this file from, and so that a
//! second caller cannot acquire the old behaviour by accident. The *other*
//! direction is filtered at the commands instead, by `without_token`: `write`
//! and `read` are what `weights` itself calls to find the fallback copy, and a
//! filter down there would hide the token from the only code entitled to it.
//!
//! A Clear the credential store refuses is an `Err`, not a quiet success. The
//! two failures look identical from here - no store at all, or a store that
//! will not let go - and `weights::write_token` is what tells them apart; only
//! the second one can leave a secret behind, and the user has to hear about it.
