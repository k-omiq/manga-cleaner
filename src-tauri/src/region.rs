//! The four region-level edits that need an engine: `applyTool`,
//! `createRegion`, `rerunMask` and `cleanAnyway`.
//!
//! This is the other half of the specification. Its two easy siblings -
//! `deleteMask` and `restoreRegion` - are in [`crate::library`], because
//! deleting a mask is a boolean on a persisted record; these four each have to
//! **run a rung over one region**, which is everything [`crate::run`] does for
//! a page with the queue, the events and the escalation loop taken away.
//!
//! ## Nothing here is a second pipeline
//!
//! Every part that decides what a patch *is* - the ladder, the quality metric,
//! the provenance snapshot, the mask digest - is [`crate::run`]'s and is called
//! from here rather than restated. A region cleaned by hand and a region
//! cleaned by a run are identical in kind, and the only way to keep that
//! true is for both to go through the same code. What this module owns is the
//! three things a run does not have to answer:
//!
//! - **where the mask comes from**, which is the caller's rectangle for a hand
//!   gesture, the stored mask for a re-run, and the detector for a region the
//!   gate held back;
//! - **which rung runs**, which is the one the user named - every picker in
//!   the interface names a model outright - or the route's own where nobody
//!   named anything;
//! - **what to say when nothing could be done**, which is a notice rather than
//!   a silent `null`.
//!
//! ## A named rung is run, and not scored against
//!
//! The decline is a rule about a choice **nobody watched being made**: an
//! automatic run picks a rung, and if the metric says the pixels are wrong the
//! region is left alone rather than filled badly. A user who opens the picker
//! and chooses *LaMa* has watched it. So [`Choice::Exact`] commits what the
//! rung produced and records
//! the metric's verdict in `params_snapshot` - the same field a run writes it
//! to - where [`Choice::Ladder`] keeps the run's own behaviour, escalating past
//! a declined rung and refusing when the top one declines too.
//!
//! ## The cloud rung is reached only with a grant
//!
//! A region is rendered in the cloud only when the caller brings a grant:
//! `grantNonce`, `executionTarget`, `recipe` and `intent` in `params`, the
//! four things consent minted it for. `applyTool`, `rerunMask` and
//! `cleanAnyway` then hand the region to
//! [`crate::inference::service::InferenceService::execute_cloud_render`],
//! which checks the grant against the region as it is on disk before anything
//! is sent. Its phases go out as `cloud://attempt` events, and a render that
//! does not commit is answered with a stable code, never with an error's text.
//!
//! Everything else stays local. With the permission switch off, a cloud
//! request is `blocked` with `notice.cloud.blocked`, grant or no grant. A cloud
//! engine named without a grant is `needs-confirmation` from `applyTool` and a
//! refusal from the other edits. `createRegion` never renders in the cloud:
//! consent binds to a stored region, which a hand-drawn one is not until this
//! command writes it, so the region is created with the local default for its
//! fill mode and the interface asks for the cloud render on it next. Automatic
//! runs never reach the cloud at all.
