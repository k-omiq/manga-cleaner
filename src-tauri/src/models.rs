//! What is loaded, for the tab in the corner of the editor.
//!
//! Two commands over [`cleaner_core::registry`], and neither of them touches a
//! session. `list_loaded_models` reads the rows; `unload_model` sets a flag on
//! one, which the thread that owns the session reads at its next region
//! boundary and acts on there ([`crate::run::Pipeline::reap`]). Nothing here
//! can interrupt an inference, which is the property that makes a close button
//! on a model safe to offer at all.
//!
//! **What the user sees is therefore one poll behind the truth, in both
//! directions**, and the interface is written for that: a model can finish and
//! vanish between two polls, and a model asked to unload keeps its row until
//! the run reaches a safe point. The row says which of those it is -
//! `unloading` - so the tab can show the request rather than pretending it
//! already happened.
//!
//! No English crosses the seam: a row
//! carries the i18n key for what it is and the key for where it is running, and
//! the interface names both.
//!
//! ## And a third: where models *would* run
//!
//! `list_accelerators` is the same subject one step earlier. The two above
//! answer "what is loaded"; this one answers "what can this machine run models
//! on, which of those will it use, and why" - the question the accelerator
//! setting is made of. It lives here rather than beside `about` because it is
//! about models and hardware rather than about the licence, and because it
//! shares this module's rule that a row carries keys and never English.
//!
//! It is also where the reporting side is closed: `accel::Selection::declined`
//! has carried four refusal reasons and reached no interface. Every one of
//! them is on this call's per-model rows now, with the two byte figures the
//! memory refusal carries.
