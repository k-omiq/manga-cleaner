//! The model catalogue, and the six commands that act on it.
//!
//! The weights are downloaded after install and verified against a pinned
//! manifest. Until now the only thing that did either was
//! `scripts/fetch-models.sh`, a developer's script, so a user who installed the
//! application got an interface that offered every engine and a run that failed
//! on the first page for want of a file they had no way to fetch. This module
//! is the manifest and the fetcher.
//!
//! ## The table is the authority and the script mirrors it
//!
//! [`MODELS`] carries the same artefacts `scripts/fetch-models.sh` fetches,
//! with the same digests and the same URLs, and
//! `the_script_and_the_table_agree` parses the script and asserts it - the same
//! relationship `runtime::package` already has with `scripts/fetch-runtime.sh`.
//! Two copies of a digest that can drift is a download that verifies against
//! the wrong number, which is worse than not verifying at all.
//!
//! `bytes` is on the table for one reason and it is not the progress bar (the
//! response's `Content-Length` is better for that): **it is how `installed` is
//! decided without hashing 200 MB**. A settings dialog that digested every
//! weight it can see would take the better part of a minute to open on a cold
//! cache. So presence plus size is the cheap answer, a full digest is what a
//! download does once on the way in, and [`verify_model`] is the explicit
//! re-check for a file somebody suspects.
//!
//! What a digest *did* answer is remembered, though, in
//! `<app_data>/models/.verified.json`, keyed by the file it was computed from:
//! path, mtime and length. A row therefore keeps its `sha256Ok` across launches
//! and loses it the moment the file underneath changes - which is the whole
//! point of stamping it, and is why the cache is beside the models rather than
//! in the settings store.
//!
//! ## What is downloaded and what is only found
//!
//! [`crate::run::model_search_paths`] has five entries and this module writes
//! to exactly one of them - `<app_data>/models`. A weight found under
//! `$MANGA_CLEANER_MODELS`, beside the executable, or in the bundle's
//! `Resources` is **read-only**: it belongs to a developer's checkout or to the
//! installer, and deleting it from a settings dialog would either fail on
//! permissions or silently break a second application. The row says so and the
//! Delete button is not offered.
//!
//! ## The token
//!
//! All but one of the artefacts are on Hugging Face, which rate-limits anonymous
//! downloads and gates some repositories outright. The token is sent as a
//! bearer token **to `huggingface.co` and to nothing else** - see [`authorize`],
//! which is the only place that reads it - and it is never logged, never
//! returned by [`list_models`], and never put in a URL.
//!
//! It lives in the operating system's credential store, under the service
//! `com.mangacleaner.studio` and the user `huggingface`: the macOS Keychain,
//! the Windows Credential Manager, the Secret Service or the kernel keyring on
//! Linux. [`TokenStore`] is the one seam that store is reached through, so the
//! decisions around it - migrate the old plaintext copy, fall back when there
//! is no store to be had - are testable against an in-memory one.
//!
//! **The fallback is real and it is not a failure.** A headless Linux box has
//! no Secret Service and may have no kernel keyring either; a locked keychain
//! answers with an error rather than a secret. In that case the token stays in
//! `settings.json` exactly as it did before, and the interface says so -
//! `tokenStore` on the view is `keychain` or `file` and the Settings note reads
//! differently for the two. Refusing to store the token at all would trade a
//! file-permissions problem for a rate-limited download.
//!
//! ## What a press answers
//!
//! Three of the commands used to answer `bool`, and two of those booleans were
//! carrying more than one fact. [`DeleteOutcome`] and [`DownloadStart`] are
//! those facts pulled apart:
//! a delete found nothing, found something it does not own, or removed it; a
//! download started, was already running, or had nothing to do. **Every one of
//! them is another window's doing.** This application has one window today, but
//! the download registry is process-wide and a second Settings dialog would
//! draw its rows from a snapshot taken before the first one pressed anything -
//! so the refusals are the shape of two windows disagreeing, and each of them
//! is a sentence rather than a silence.
//!
//! A deleted weight also **evicts the session built from it**
//! ([`resident_kind`]). Nothing is emitted for that: what is loaded is a poll
//! by design, and this takes the same path `unload_model` does.
//!
//! ## Which runtime
//!
//! `runtime::package` describes more than one build for Windows and Linux x64
//! and exactly one for everywhere else. The chosen one is an ordinary setting,
//! [`FLAVOUR_SETTING`], and everything that reads it goes through
//! `package::for_host_flavour`, which resolves an id this platform does not
//! publish to the platform's default - so a settings file copied from a Windows
//! machine to a Mac downloads the Mac's build rather than nothing. The row
//! reports the flavour, its version and its **whole download size** so the
//! picker can put 215 MB against 455 MB in front of the person choosing.
//!
//! ## Resuming
//!
//! A `.part` survives a cancellation and a failure; only a digest mismatch
//! deletes it. The next press sends `Range: bytes=<len>-` and, on a `206`,
//! re-hashes the bytes already on disk before continuing - a few seconds per
//! 200 MB, once, which is the price of `sha2` having no way to persist a
//! `Sha256` mid-stream. A `200` means the server ignored the range and the file
//! starts again. See [`fetch_verified`].
//!
//! Those kept bytes are also disk nobody asked to spend, so the row **says how
//! many there are** - `partialBytes` - and offers [`discard_partial`] to give
//! them back - the runtime's row counting its whole `.downloads` directory,
//! complete archives included, because one kept for a re-unpack is bytes held
//! for a press that may never come just as a `.part` is. A `.part` stamped with
//! a digest this catalogue no longer names is a different matter: nothing will
//! ever resume it, because the press that would is looking for a differently
//! stamped file, so [`list_models`] sweeps those without asking.
//!
//! Both presses take the download registry's lock across the decision **and**
//! the unlink ([`while_not_downloading`]): asking whether an id is downloading
//! and then deleting its `.part` leaves a gap one [`claim`] wide, and a file a
//! writer has just opened is exactly what must not be removed.
//!
//! ## Which runtime is *installed*
//!
//! `runtime_row`'s `flavour` and `version` are the build that **would** be
//! downloaded. What is on disk is a different question and no amount of looking
//! at the files answers it, so a successful install writes down what it
//! unpacked: `<app_data>/runtimes/.installed.json`, the flavour, the version
//! and the file names ([`InstalledRuntime`]). The row carries it back as
//! `installedFlavour` and `installedVersion`, and Settings says so only when it
//! differs from the choice. The file list is the other half: switching
//! build removes whatever the previous stamp named that the new archive did not
//! bring, so no foreign library is left beside the one that will be loaded.
//!
//! ## Replacing a runtime on Windows
//!
//! Everything above was written and measured on macOS, and one of its
//! assumptions is false on Windows: that a file can be deleted while something
//! has it open. It cannot, and **the file in question is always open**. `ort`
//! loads `onnxruntime.dll` through `libloading` and keeps it in a `OnceLock`
//! for the life of the process; `models::list_accelerators` calls
//! `cleaner_core::runtime::load`; and `list_accelerators` is what fills in the
//! settings dialog the Download, flavour-switch and Delete buttons live in. So
//! the library is mapped before any of those buttons can be pressed, the first
//! install worked and every replacement after it failed with a sharing
//! violation.
//!
//! Windows will, however, **rename** a mapped file to another name in the same
//! directory - the mapping is to the file, not to the name. That asymmetry is
//! the whole fix: [`clear_target`] renames what it cannot delete to
//! `<name>.old-<n>`, the new library moves into the name that was freed, and
//! [`sweep_replaced`] deletes the aside copy from a later session that never
//! mapped it. A refusal to do even that is [`NOTICE_IN_USE`], which is a
//! sentence the user can act on rather than an `os error 32`.
//!
//! Two other things about that platform, in the same place because they were
//! found together. A Windows package is three artefacts and used to report as
//! three downloads under one id ([`Portion`]). And its archives unpack to far
//! more than they transfer - `onnxruntime.pdb` alone is about 408 MB behind a
//! 12 MB download - so the volume is asked first ([`room_to_install`],
//! [`unpacked_bytes`]) and the files nothing can load are not written at all
//! ([`is_loadable`]).
