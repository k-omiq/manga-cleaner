//! The event channel: the five events, and the registry that
//! carries them to the webview.
//!
//! The seam has one rule about progress and it is absolute: **progress arrives
//! only on the event channel**. `subscribe(handler)` is one handler and many
//! events, never a callback per call, because a Tauri `invoke` cannot return a
//! streaming result and no component may come to depend on timing a real
//! backend could not provide.
//!
//! ## Why a registry rather than `AppHandle::emit`
//!
//! Tauri's own event system would work and is the wrong shape. `emit` is a
//! broadcast keyed by a string name, delivered to whatever listeners a window
//! happens to have; the seam wants a single ordered stream owned by one
//! subscriber. A [`Channel`](tauri::ipc::Channel) is exactly that - the
//! frontend constructs it, hands it to a command, and every message the
//! backend sends on it arrives at that one handler, in order. So `subscribe`
//! becomes: build a channel, register it here, and unregister it when the last
//! handler goes.
//!
//! The registry is a process-global rather than Tauri managed state for one
//! reason: `Builder::manage` is called in `lib.rs`, which the run is not
//! allowed to edit, and a `manage` call made later from inside a command
//! races the first caller. A `OnceLock<Mutex<…>>` needs neither.
//!
//! ## Why a sink and not a channel
//!
//! [`Sink`] is a closure rather than a `Channel<Event>` so that the run
//! scheduler - where all the ordering
//! rules live - can be tested against a collector without a Tauri runtime.
//! What the tests exercise is then the same code path the window uses, with a
//! different last inch.
//!
//! ## What this closes
//!
//! Until now the ten implemented
//! seam methods emitted nothing, so inside a Tauri window every notice they
//! owed was silently gone - `notice.project.created`, `notice.chapter.added`,
//! `notice.export.finished`, and the input reports persisted so that
//! `openChapter` could stagger them. They are emitted from the command
//! wrappers rather than from [`crate::library::Library`]'s methods, because
//! the model is deliberately testable without a runtime and a global emit
//! inside it would leak between unit tests.
