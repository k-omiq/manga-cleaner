//! The undo journal: delta commands on disk, beside the job they belong to.
//!
//! Undo used to be
//! a stack of JavaScript closures in `src/lib/model/history.js` - one per edit,
//! each holding two whole region snapshots, all of it lost when the window
//! closed. Two things were wrong with that and only one of them was the
//! forgetting:
//!
//! 1. **It could not survive a page leaving RAM.** A closure over a region on
//!    page 140 keeps that region alive for as long as the history does, which is
//!    the whole session. The three-page
//!    window evicts page 140's regions
//!    and the closure quietly kept its own copy - the eviction gave back
//!    nothing.
//! 2. **It did not survive a restart**, so a chapter reopened after a crash had
//!    a manifest full of edits and no way to take any of them back.
//!
//! So the history is *data*, it lives on disk, and the interface holds one
//! `{seq, label}` pair per entry - enough to say what Undo would reverse, and
//! nothing else. The payload is read back one entry at a time, at the moment it
//! is replayed. **RAM is flat in edit count**; disk is not, and disk is what
//! this application has.
//!
//! ## Where it lives
//!
//! `<job>.mtclean.d/history.json` - the sidecar directory, alongside the masks
//! and patch buffers a delta refers to. That is deliberate: an entry references
//! a region id and a mask id, never pixels, and the pixels those ids name are
//! already in this directory under the soft-delete discipline
//! `library::set_mask_visible` describes. A journal that carried its own copy of
//! anything would be a second opinion about what a region is.
//!
//! ## Why the whole file is rewritten
//!
//! An append-only log is the obvious shape and it is the wrong one here: undo
//! moves a cursor backwards and the next edit **truncates the future**, which an
//! append-only file cannot express without a compaction pass nobody would ever
//! test. The journal is capped at [`JOURNAL_LIMIT`] entries, each of them a few
//! hundred bytes, so the whole document is tens of kilobytes and the rewrite is
//! one `write_atomic` - the same temp-fsync-rename every other write in this
//! application uses.
//!
//! The cap is a **behaviour change**: the session-only history was
//! unlimited, and an unlimited *persisted* history is an unbounded term in a
//! budget whose whole claim is that it is bounded.
