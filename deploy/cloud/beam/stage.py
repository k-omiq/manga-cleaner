"""The clean directory Beam uploads for one deploy.

Beam uploads the whole working directory and names each container handler after the
module path relative to it, so the provisioner deploys from a fresh directory that
holds only the app module at its root, the part of the deploy package the containers
import, and an ignore file. Nothing from the user's machine besides these files is
uploaded. This module does not import beam.
